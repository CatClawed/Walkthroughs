This is a repository containing all my walkthroughs. I no longer contribute to GFAQs since I created my own website, so this is more of an archive/backup than anything. Many of these guides are now either Creative Commons or Public Domain.

If you're wondering what I'm especially proud of in this collection, it's Trails in the Sky SC. I did the maps and a lot of other things. Insane effort.

For the most part, my thinking regarding guides has shifted away from the format that GFAQs encourages, so I wouldn't usually write the same sort of content now.
