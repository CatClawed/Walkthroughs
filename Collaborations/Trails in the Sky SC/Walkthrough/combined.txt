==Battle System==

In Trails in the Sky, the battle system is similar to SRPGs. You are in a gridline battlefield fighting enemies.
However, the pacing is still Turn-based at heart. So, there's no need to place your movement towards your enemy and
fight. In SC, not much has changed aside from one additional game mechanic.

===Turn Order (Bonus Icons)===
If you look at your left, it indicates the order of the turns in battle. Occasionally, you'll see a bonus
icon right next to the ally or the enemy. These bonus icons will give you or your opponent an edge during
that turn. Also, you can bypass the turn order by using S-Break. The following below are 6 possible bonus icons.

|* Name             |* Effect                                              |
| Heal HP           | Recovers 10% or 50% of HP                            |
| Charge EP         | Recovers 10% or 50% of EP                            |
| CP UP             | Recovers 10% or 50% of CP                            |
| STR UP            | Increases Physical or Magic attack by 10% or 50%     |
| Crtical           | All Attack, Magic or Recovery effects increases 1.5X |
| Sepith UP         | Steals Sepith from Target                            |

===Craft and S-Break===

====CP (Craft Points)====
All characters possess CP. From the beginning of the battle, you start out with zero CP. The only way to
gain CP is to successfully attack or recieve damage from your opponent. Once you have gotten a sufficent
amount of CP, you can use those to use your Craft or even S-Craft at your disposal. You can accumulate
your CP and save it for later.

====Chain Craft====
This is the only new addition for SC. Basically, you can have 2-4 people attack your opponent in one turn.
In order to use chain craft, select Chain and choose your allies to assist you. You and your selected ally
must be in close proximity as well as your opponent. If you did it correctly, you can unleash 2-4 hits in
one turn. The only drawback is that your chosen ally will take the turn as well. So, use chain craft
wisely.

====Craft====
It's the character's special moves. They can be learned as they gain levels. All craft ablities take up
CP.

====S-Craft====
Think of it as this game's equivalent of Limit Break. Anytime you reach 100 CP, you can unleash their
powerful attack. But, there's a much more effective use for it....

====S-Break====
As stated earlier, you can use S-Break for cutting the next person's turn. But, you have to accumulate
a minimum of 100 CP to use it. When you do accumulate 100 CP, the orb on the HUD will glow red. Anyway,
during someone's turn, you can toggle left or right and press "X". However, it's perferable if you use
the shortcut command by pressing triangle and press the directional buttons on the d-pad. Once you
activate S-Break, you will unleash your S-Craft anywhere on the battlefield. This can be useful for
killing off those pesky enemies with "Self-Destruct" ability. Finally, if you have 200 CP, you
can dish out even more damage.

===Orbal Quartz===

====Sepith====
Each enemies drop sepith after you defeat them. You can save those up for Quartz or even sell it for
money.

====Quartz====
Since sepith comes in various forms, you can use those to make Quartz. For the most part, each of the
quartz can increase your parameters. Also, each time you equip a quartz, you gain arts. However, there's
a specific way on how to gain more arts.

====Slots and lines====
At the start of the game, there will be some slot closures and it's up to you to open those slots. To unlock
those slots, you must have the adequate amount of Sepiths. Please note that the slots have a specific trait.
For example, if you look at Joshua's slots, there are some slot that's Time Elemental only. Obviously, you
can only equip Time-Elemental quartz on that slot.

For all playable characters, they each have a central slot. Whatever quartz is in the central slot, they
will govern the elemental values. There are some characters who have only possess a single line while some have
various lines that branches out. The lines will add the overall elemental values equipped on each end. For those
who only has a single line can add more elemental values. With that, you'll have access to higher level arts.


===Bracers Guild===

This is practically the bulk of the game. All quests start out in the guild. By doing those quests, you are
rewarded with money, items and etc. Also, BP (Bracer Points) will be added on your overall tally. The more BP you
have, the higher your rank will be. Finally, if you have made the right decisions during the dialogue or you have
been proactive towards certain missions, you can gain extra BP. This will be extra useful especially if you are
going for the perfect score...

===Misc===

====Cooking====
Even though Estelle is not the best cook out there, she can still pull of those dishes in a pinch. To obtain those
dishes, you must first eat the food to gain the recipe. Once you have the recipe, be sure to have the right ingredients
and cook it. For the most part, it recovers HP, EP or CP with some temporary increase in parameters. So, don't neglect
it!

====Fishing====
If you remember that one-time minigame from FC, then you'll be happy to hear that it is a full-fledged minigame in SC.
Cast your rod into water and wait for the right time to reel your catch.

==Tips and Tricks==

Like all the other games out there, here are some tricks of the trade for you to survive this game.

1)--u--'''''Multiple saves is a must'''''--u--

For the completionist people out there, this is mandatory. There's a bunch of hidden quests waiting to be uncovered. Even the most minor
implication during your major quest could screw you over for the rest of the game. So, every time you are about attempt something significant, make sure
you make another save file before moving on.

(P.S. If you make an oopsie the game does keep a small amount of autosaves.)

2)--u--'''''Relax and decide your next move'''''--u--

I know what you did there. You have done something that cost you extra BP and chances are your last save is over 5 hours long. Regardless your outcome,
there's always an option: either go back to your last save file and work from there or you decide to move on. If you decided to do the latter, there's always
New Game+. You can always make up the lost BP from the last playthough.

3)--u--'''''Take the time to explore around'''''--u--

If you decide to get BP honestly, I suggest you look around and talk to NPC before the next major mission. Many of the hidden items and quest all happen
within the small time frame. Also, Rushing through the game can work against you for the same reason.

4)--u--'''''The Bracer Notebook is your bible'''''--u--

Seriously, the contents inside his really comprehensive. It has all the notes you need such as your quest progress, Arts and quartz elemental
values. It even has most of the basic stuff covered in the manual. If there's something you want to know, it's likely inside
the Bracer's Notebook. Don't be afraid to look up something once in a while.

===Playable Characters===
''NOTE: Work in progress! Characters who appeared in FC will continue to be analyzed to see any gameplay changes.''

====Estelle Bright====
'''She is the daughter of the legendary Bracer Cassius Bright. Because of her jovial
personality, she'll perservere even if the odds are against her.'''

Estelle is one of the characters that's available for entire game for obvious reasons. She is a versatile character,
and her orbment slots can use every elements available. As far
as orbal arts combination goes, she's can insert several mid-level magics in one line. However, putting some of the demanding
arts such as Titanic Roar, Volcanic Rave and etc. in one line could be difficult. Her crafts are pretty diverse overall.

Her versatility does not end in magic spells. Her crafts have a diverse moveset and are useful in various situations.
For example, she has morale to raise her allies stats in battle.
Also, she learns a crowd control attack early on in the game as well as a skill that interupts the foe's spell casting.
Her S-Craft such as Barrage and Pummel are useful against a single opponent. It is recommended to use it
against bosses. Her only drawback is that specialized characters such as Olivier, Kloe or Agate
overshadow her versatile abilities. Other than that, she's a well-rounded character due to being the protagonist.
She has a lot of tools in her disposal and has flexible orbal moveset.

====Anelace Elfead====
'''A young woman who is a senior bracer. Although she is a few years older than Estelle, she has a bubbly personality and
a weakness for cute objects.'''

Like Estelle, Anelace is a well-rounded character. She has a wide variety of crafts she can use in the battlefield. For example,
she can use fallen leaves to knockback her opponent for a few turns. She can also use Petal Dance to give her a great strength
buff with the cost of her defense. Her art usage is servicable at best because she has three lines on her orbment slots. She
can do basic arts, but that's as far as she can go. You may have to rely more on her crafts than her arts. She could be a great
person to have as a group, but she only appears on the prologue! So, don't get too attached with her.

====Agate Crosner====
'''A young, burly Bracer who wields a broad sword. He tends to look down on Junior Bracers.'''

In contrast to FC, you have the option to choose him or Scherazard at the start of chapter I. He's definitely a great asset
to the group because of his exceptional strength and his unique moveset. For instance, he is the only character who can raise his CP
with the cost of his max HP. If he does not have enough CP, he can use Wild Rage 2 for the first turn and use S-break after he uses Wild Rage.
He has some attacks such as Draguna Edge and Flame Edge to deal damage against a group of foes. It also helps that Draguna Edge
has a much wider line compared to the other character's line attack. He also has Sprial Edge which inflicts AT delay to a single
foe. But his S-Craft is exceptionally useful. Regardless if it's a single attack (Beat Down) or a group attack (Final Break) the
damage will be devastating. However his raw power does come with a price. He has one the worst magic defense in the game.
His arts are very limited due to having multiple branches on his orbal quartz. So, you are pretty much going to use
his Orbal Slots for raising his parameters. Overall, you going to use Agate as your frontline attacker. With Wild Rage 2, you are
going to use his S-Craft frequently.

====Scherazard Harvey====
'''Nicknamed "The Silver Streak", she is former disiple of the legendary Bracer. Though she is
an intelligent person and uses Tarot Cards for divinity purposes, she is a heavy drinker'''

Like Agate, Scherazard can be used as early as Chapter I. She specializes on wind arts and deals mid-range
She can certainly deal damage. Her whip is medium range; meaning that her range is far enough to prevent
her from getting hit from self destruct. Her moveset are okay to use. Her first craft can deal damage to a small
group of foes. Her bind whip is useful because she has the ability to mute spell casters. Finally, her
Heaven's Kiss can increase her allies speed. For the most part, she is average. She's really useful
early game. But once late game comes in, she is pretty much outclassed by her other peers.

====Kevin Graham====
'''He is a priest from a far away land. Under his gentle smile, his reasons of coming to Liberl is currently unknown'''

Similar to Olivier, Kevin uses a long-range weapon. His main element is time, which allows him to use time arts at its
highest potential. Interestingly, he has two lines but one of them only has one orbal slot. Use slot 2 for any stat
enhancement. You want to focus on line one because this is where you'll want to increase magic capabilities. This will
allow him to use any high level arts. Although his crafts are limited, they serve a different purpose. For example, his
Sacrifical Arrow can redistribute his CP to other party members within range. Also, his S-Craft is not like the other
characters. For example, his Grail Sphere grants immunity to incoming attacks for one turn. This is extremely useful
for battles because you can withstand a catastrophic attack. If you have 200 CP, you are immune to damage until the enemy attacks
you twice. His only drawback is lousy move stat and strength. Other than that, Kevin is a great character to use.

====Olivier Lenheim====
''' Coming from an Eberonian background, he travels south to play music for the citizens of Liberl.
With his charismatic personality, he tends to hit on anyone he sees.'''

His defining personality is his charisma; although it won't help much in battle. Anyway, he's one of the few characters
that uses long range weapon. Also, his main element is mirage, which is a neutral element. Having mirage will enable him
to configure several magic combination. Because he only has a single line in his orbal slot setup, he has access to
the high level arts. Having a neutral element along with a flexible orbal configuration benefits Olivier's playstyle.

His crafts on the other hand also useful as well. His Quick Draw has the ability to hit the target where you wanted it.
Because of his range, his Snipe Shoot can easily take out the spell casters. Finally, his Happy Trigger can cure
people within range. Although it's minimal, his CP consumption is really low. He only has one S-Craft in the game and
the damage is mediocre. His weaknesses is are low HP, low Defense and limited movement.
Ironically, Olivier has the lowest magical defense in the game considering him possessing one of the highest Magic Attack power in the game.
Overall, Oliver is another effective character to use. You really can't go wrong with diverse arts as well as utilitarian
moveset. Plus with his range, he can be a threat in the battlefield.


====Kloe Rinz====
'''A second year student in Jenis Academy. She is a very sweet young woman who have a mutual understanding
with her pet Gryfalcon, Sieg.'''

She specializes on healing magic as evidenced by her water affinity. Also, she does possess a single line orbal
slot. However, her customization is somewhat limited because three of her orbal slots are Water only. Therefore, she needs to rely
on water arts to be useful. Her craft is minimal at best becayse she only has two regular crafts and one S-craft at her disposal. She has
Kaempfer (Impose) which debuffs the foe's STR and DEF andSturm  (Encroach) which interupts the person's spell casting time. But compared to the other
characters, her Encroach needs to hit up close in order to be effective. Finally, her Radiant Plash has the largest healing range out of
everyone. It's already great on its own considering the amount of HP it restores plus it also revives allies as well. If you use it at 200 EP, not only it
does more recovery, it gives out free Defense buff. Overall, despite of Kloe's restrictive orbal customization, her usefulness certainly lies with
her healing powers. Also, having the highest EP as well as high magic attack power, she can be the magical powerhouse of the group.

==Prologue: A Maiden's Resolve==

As soon as you take control of Estelle, head west towards the garden terrace. You'll find her father at
the balcony. Once you get off the airship, it's time for you to head home. Head out the city of Rolent and
go west in Elize Highway. There, you'll find Estelle's house.

After a brief conversation with Anelace, head upstairs and go to the room at the end of the hall.
Estelle's room is right by the pink flowers. As she enters her room she'll pick up [[Break Rod]],
[[Enhanced Leather]], [[Reinforced Boots]], and ''1000 Mira''. As soon as you have your stuff, head
downstairs and take your seat at the table right next to Anelace. If you carried over your perfect file
from the previous game, you'll be rewarded with these items. They are: [[Glove Gear]], [[Celestial Balm]],
[[Emergency Puppet]], and [[Luck Quartz]].

Talk to Phyllis to get the [[Recipe Book]] along with the [[Nature's Bounty]] recipe. She'll give you an
assortment of ingredients for you to whip up a meal. Be sure to buy [[Liberl News - Issue 1]], as it's missable.
[[Herb Sandwich]] isn't a bad idea either, but you can get it later if you forget. Then talk to Robert and buy
[[HP 1]] quartz. Once you have a restorative art, talk to Kurt near the exit. From there, head to Balstar channel.

^l4|Balstar Channel: Other Half
^l5|Balstar Channel: Starting Half

''NOTE: If you are looking at the map, the starting point is actually the exit. You are going deep within the dungeon''


Once you get the [[Surpise Cookie]], this will be the first of food items that actually are attack
items. Use these to kill 10 enemies for an achievement. You have plenty of time.

After Kurt brief you on your mission, he'll give you a [[Monster Guide]]. As you go forward, you'll engage your first enemy.
You have the option to learn the basics of combat or learn chain crafts. If you want all the monsters, you have to go over the basics.
After the tutorial battle, head to the next room. In the second area, the path will split into three paths. If you take the path in
the --u--center--u--, you'll find a lever. Pull the lever to the right to activate the bridge on your right side. If you head over to
that bridge, it'll lead to the next area.

|* Area 3 |

East, keep going right until you find a lever. This will drain the water in the sewers. From the sewage drain, head left
towards the first bridge from the lever. This leads to another bridge lever. Then go to the bridge from the entrance. You'll see that
the water is drained and you have access to the watery path. Keep going foward until you hit a dead end. There, you'll find another treasure
that contains an enemy. If you defeat it, you'll find [[Proxy Puppet]]. Then head up the stairs and go forward. You should be past the bridge and
you'll find three more treasures at the end of the path. They contain [[Tear Balm]], [[Reviving Balm]], and [[EP Charge]].
That should be everything on this side. Time to head back to Area 2 and go to the other path.

Anyway, back to the lever in area two. This time pull the lever to the ''left side'' to activate the bridge on your left. Back to
the T-intersection, take the --u--left path--u-- and you'll find
another lever. It doesn't matter which side you pull in, it will activate the bridge. Anyway, once you activate both bridges, head
to the bridge on the left side and go foward. Proceed until you hit another T-intersection. When you arrive at the T-intersection,
go right. You'll find three treasure boxes containing [[Mind 1]], [[Tear Balm]], and [[EP Charge]]. Now, go back to the T-Intersection and
go up. This will lead to the next area.

|* Area 4 |

There should be a lever nearby. Activate it, and the bridge on your right side will activate. Keep going forward until you find
[[Attack 1]] at the end of the path. Next, head back and cross the bridge north of the entrance. There should be a small T-intersection nearby.
Go left and you'll find a lever that drains the water. Go right and you'll activate another bridge. You need to do both of those in order
to traverse through the dungeon. Go straight, and you'll find [[Silver Earring]] right in the middle of the torches. Head down the stairs,
and you'll traverse to a watery path. Before you head up to the stairs on the other side, there are few treasures to lookout for. Continue
to move west until you hit a T-intersection at the end of the path. Go north, and you'll find a monster treasure. Defeat the monster mob and
you'll find [[Cast 1]]. Then head to the opposite direction and you should end up in a platform with three treasures. They contain [[Reviving Balm]],
[[Surprise Cookie]], and ''x10 sepith of each element''.

Once you found all the treasures on the waterway, head up the stairs on the opposite end. The path should split into two. The left path leads to
a treasure box containing [[EP Charge]]. Head right and it should lead to the bridge where you activated near the entrance. There should be one
more lever nearby. Pull the lever and another bridge activates. Go forward to Area 5. Watch out, you'll engage to a boss battle.

=--Boss: Kurt--=
When he attempts to attack one of your allies, not only it deals damage, it also pushes your ally towards the edge of the battlefield. He uses
Fengshu:Steel to raise his defense. This battle is very easy because he is vulnerable against magic attacks. So use Arts to deal damage from afar.
Also, use Chain and S-Craft to deal heavy damage.
=-=

After the battle is over and your conversation with Anelace, talk to Robert before you head off to bed. And do be sure to note the amount of shoes in
Estelle's room. :)

|* La Locle Canyon: Nightfall |

The first extra BP is coming up. When Estelle hears gunshot choose: --u--''WAKE UP''--u--! After your conversation with Anelace, head downstairs.
You'll engage in battle with one of the Jaeger Mercenaries. ''If you managed to win against the Jaeger Mercenary, you get another extra BP.''

===Saint Croix Forest===

|  5 | [[Reinforced Boots]] | -- | [[EP Charge]] x2     | [[Jaeger Woman]]  |

^l6|St. Croix Forest

''NOTE: On the map, the word "tent" is the starting point of the dungeon.''

During the conversation with Anelace, choose the second option --u--''The Attacking Invaders''--u--.
By choosing the second option, you get another extra BP. After you take control, examine the tent. You'll find five [[Teara Balm]]
and two [[EP Charge]]. Before you do anything else, be sure that your camera is facing north. If you have the PC version, the map
icon on the right corner has a compass point that's facing north.

Anyway, keep going straight until the first intersection. If you move north, there should be a monster named Rolling Thorn nearby.
This will lead to area 2 if you decide to traverse deeper to the dungeon. However, we are finding treasure boxes. So, on the first
intersection, head east. You should see a treasure chest near the Bush Lancer. It contains [[Enhanced Leather]]. Once you have it,
proceed to Area 2.

|* Area 2 |

Keep going straight until you find the log bridge. Instead of crossing the log bridge, head right and be sure to shift your
camera slightly your left to see a small path. Move forward to the small path and you'll find another chest containing [[Reinforced Boots]].
Continue to move forward until area 3.

|* Area 3 |

Be sure to hug the wall on the right side and move forward. There should be a small path deviating from the main path. Once
you find the small path, there should be a chest containing [[Fencer]]]. Continue to move towards the end of the small path, you'll find
[[Break Rod]]. Once you are in the main path, head to your right and you'll find another [[Reinforced Boots]]. Then go back to the
intersection and move north.

|* Area 4 |

There is a small path that leads to the riverbed. Before you walk on the stream, shift your camera north so that your
character is facing against the current. From there, walk against the river current. You should see a chest containing [[Nature's Bounty]].
Once you have the treasure, cross the river to the other side of the land, and proceed forward. When crossed the river on the other side,
there should be a pine tree in the middle of the open grassy field. Right below it contains a treasure chest containing [[EP Charge]]
Now, it's a good time to shift your camera again so the map icon on the corner is facing north. If you are playing this on the PSP,
make sure your camera is facing north so that the Saint-Croix sign is on the upper left corner. Once you done that, head south and
you'll enter a small area in area 2. You'll find another [[Enhanced Leather]]. Once you opened the last chest, it's time to leave the forest
by going forward past the sign. Be sure to heal up before taking a step forward. There, you'll find another boss

=--Boss: Female Jaeger--=

She attacks from a distance using her machine gun. She uses grenade to deal moderate damage to one of your
ally. Next, she'll use shock gun to cancel spell casting. If you get too close to her, she'll use scatter
shot to deal damage to your allies. This is slightly tougher than the fight against Kurt because the
Female Jaeger is intentionally keeping her distance and deal long range damage. However, you have arts to
counterattack her long range attacks. Also, it's a good idea use Estelle's comet to deal damage from afar.
If you are within the Female Jaeger's proximity attack using her crafts, chain crafts, and S Crafts.

=-=

Once the battle is over, it's time to go to the lodge.

===Guild Lodge===

|*Misc. Treasures |
|[[Gambler Jack - Vol. 1]]|

Once you are inside the lodge, examine the following.

=-----=
* The blood stain near the front door
* The broken spear next to the blood stain
* The Orbal telephone near Orbal Shop
* Food barrel near Phyllis' shop
* Shattered window
* Torn map of the region
=-=

Once you examine all six objects, Anelace and Estelle will discuss about their situation. You'll be face
yet another bonus BP opportunity. Choose --u--''Move to another base''--u--. After your conversation with
Robert, it's time to go to Grimsel Fortress. Before you go, there's a special item you need to take before
you leave. Those who are doing the achievement [[Ramblin' Gambler]], the first volume is nearby. Head
upstairs and enter the door on the lower right. There, you'll find [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 1]]. Once you have it,
head to Grimsel Fortress

^l1|A: Gambler Jack: Volume 1 location

===Grimsel Fortress===

|  3 | [[Tear Balm]]        |  6 | [[ID Unit]]          | [[Jaeger 2]]    |

^l7| Grimsel Fortress

As soon you step inside the fortress, make a left turn at the first T-intersection. You'll find [[EP Charge]] at the very end of
the hall on the very left and [[EP 1]] on the right side of the hall. Once you have those two treasures, now go to the opposite
direction at the T-intersection. Keep going straight until you find a steel gate. Enter the room on your left and pull the lever.
After your conversation with Anelace, keep going forward.

In the next area, go to the first room you see on your right. From there, Pull the lever so that the power is on. Once you are out
of the power room, head to the room right accross your location. There's a treasure containing [[Tear Balm]]. Next, head to the
end of the hall and enter the room on your left. By then, you already turn on the power switch. Therefore, the gate should open.
Keep going straight until you engage a forced battle against a group of enemy mobs. Dispach them, and proceed forward.

When you arrive at the second floor and you are in a pitched-black room, I suggest you proceed to next room where the lights
are barely dim. You'll find a unique treasure chest containing [[Night Goggles]]. Once you find the [[Night Goggles]], traverse
through the labyrinth. However, there's a treasure chest on the western end of the labyrinth. If you are able to find your way
through the dark maze on the left side of the room, you should end up in a small room with a chest containing [[EP Charge]].
Once you have the treasure, work your way into the maze once more. The exit should be at the south end of the room.

After going through the dark maze, continue to go forward. You should ascend the next set of staircases and a series of halls.
Once you are about to ascend to the 4th floor, there's a chest containing [[ID Unit]] . Go forward again until you hit a dead end.
This is where you use your ID unit. Stand next to the apparatus, go to the menu and select ID unit. Next, go to the resting unit
and save your game. Watch out for another extra BP question. Choose --u--''Don't NEED to Contact!''--u-- Here's another boss battle
coming your way.

=--Boss: Jaeger--=

He will begin the battle by casting Sqwartz Faizel, which temporary increases his strength and speed. Like Kurt, he uses his spear
to push your allies to the edge of the battlefield. He also uses charge to cancel any incoming art attacks. If your ally is using
arts from a distance, Jaeger might counter your long range attack with Sqwartz Zaubel, which deals devastating damage. Lastly, he uses Summer Shower
to deal heavy damage to your ally. You have to be very careful on how you approach this battle because he can counter your attack with
Sqwartz Zaubel if you deal heavy damage at a short period of time. So, take it slow and use any of your arts like Dark Matter, Fire Bolt
or etc. When his health is below 33%, he'll start using Sqwartz Wild which restores 1000HP. This where you start using your heavy attacks.
If possible, you can use surprise cookie to deal heavy damage against Jaeger.
=-=

After the battle is over, you'll see a series of cutscenes. This marks the end of the prologue. You should get an achievement by finishing
this chapter.

* ''End of Chapter Totals''
** BP: 16

==Chapter I: Sneaking Shadows==

====Grancel: Landing Port====

After your conversation with Anelace, you'll speak with Elnan. He will give your results from the prologue. You should have ''16/380'' BP
at this point. Also, you'll be promoted to G+ and get [[Silver Chain]] as one of the bonus perks. Next, you get to choose either Scherazard
or Agate as your companion. Also, this is where Anelace will part ways with you for good! T_T

Anyway, after your conversation with Anelace and her companion, head to the landing port shop to buy the airship tickets. Before that, be
sure to talk to the lady on the left counter so you can buy [[Liberl News - Issue 2]]. Buy your airship ticket and then talk to Finella
outside the landing port shop. Next, you are off to Ruan. At the airliner, talk to everyone at least twice. Be sure to talk to Lloyd inside the passenger
cabin. He'll give you [[Fishing Book]] and [[Progress Rod]].

After your conversation with Jean, head to the harbor by going to the south block. On your way to the warehouse, Lloyd will stop you at the moment.
He will tell you about the fishing spots by looking at the ripples on the surface of the water. He'll give you five [[Polychaete]]. After that, head
east towards the eastern warehouse. Be sure to save before entering the warehouse.

=--Boss: Deen, Rocco, and Rais--=

Deen, Rocco and Deis use the same moveset. They use invigorate to strengthen their attack power. They use shout to reduce your ally's defense.
They sometimes use Embolden to revive their ally and use Soul Infusion to heal each other. Their most threatening attack is No Mercy where they
charge their attack and inflict heavy damage against your ally. This boss battle is fairly easy. If you have any wide area of effect arts, you should
deal considerable damage. However, if you have Agate, it's even easier. Use mid-level arts do deal damage, and when the time is right use chain crafts
and S-crafts.

Once the battle is over, it's time for you to go to Belden's house. His house is next door to the mayor's home entrance and close to the Aurion Highway.
Go to the second floor, and talk to Belden. Once you hear what he has to say, you can finally leave town and go to the orphanage.

You'll find three treasure chests: one on the west side of the map on the second intersection. It contains [[Tear Balm]].
While the other one is on the shore, but you have to walk around the northern perimeter of the cliffside. You should find a chest containing
[[Surprise Cookie]] and Night Nautilus at the end of the path. Also, walk south along the beach perimeter and you should find [[Smelling Salts]].

|*Area 2 between Ruan and Mercia Orphanage |
Also, if you look at your mini-map, there's a small landmass along the shoreline. There's a huge monster blocking your way. Before you fight it,
be sure to get the treasure chest that contains [[Insulating Tape]]. Also, be sure to walk along side on the perimeter where you see number 6
at the map. You'll find [[Polychaete]]. As soon as you defeat the three Cobalt Sabers, go through the narrow
pathway, and you'll find a chest containing [[Hard Loafers]]

|*Area 3 near Mercia Orphanage|
As soon as you walk on the sandy dunes, head south and walk along the cliffside. You'll find a [[Reviving Balm]]. There should also be a chest

trigger a flashback from the first game. After a brief nostaligia trip, enter the windmill house. Once the
conversation is over, Kevin will join your party. However, he'll be a playable character until you arrive
in Ruan. In the meantime, now it's a good time to tackle the sidequests. Kevin's support abilities will do
you good for the battle-orientated sidequests. More importantly, [[there's a hidden sidequest coming up!
Don't miss this opportunity!|Lighthouse Test Run]]. Once you arrive at Ruan, Kevin will leave your party.
Your next objective is to go to Air-Letten and talk to one of the witnesses.

Since Olivier and Dorothy are now in your party, now is a good time to take on [[Sapphirl Tower Photo]]. So, it's time for you to go to Sapphirl Tower.
In case you need a refresher, a guest NPC participates in battle. They typically do not fight, so you need to protect them in each battle.
If you let the guest NPC die, it's game over for you. Anyway, we have three new sidequests for you to take on.

===Sapphirl Tower: Sidequest===
|*+4 Chests                                                   |*   Monsters          |

^l12|Sapphirl Tower

Be sure to acquire a [[Curative Horn]] from a [[Helmet Crab]] and a [[Juicy Bone]] from a [[Seahorse]]. This
should complete the [[Come, Ingredient Hunters]] sidequest. Click the link if you're still missing items.

Just outside the tower is a chest containing [[EP Cut 1]]. It's 11 because Drache made an oopsie.

If you are doing the [[Sapphirl Tower Photo]] sidequest, --u--''be sure to have Dorothy with you!''--u-- This is for max bonus BP!
When you are on the second floor, be sure to set the camera so that the map icon pointer faces north. There should be two paths: one going southwest and
the other southeast. We'll divide it into two routes.

====Southeastern route====

Go straight forward on the 3rd floor. On the fourth floor, there's 4 different stairs leading to various paths. So, the first set of stairs
leads to the fifth floor, we'll call it, '''Stair A'''. On '''Stair A''', you'll find [[Jenis Blouse]]

Head back down the and proceed to the next adjacent stairs. '''Stair B''' is going down to the third floor. On the 3rd floor, there's a path
that splits into two: One that's going south while the other goes east. If you head south, you'll see a couple of Seahorse Demons lurking around.
Between it lies a another treasure. Look out, this one contain monsters in it. Defeat it, and you'll get a [[Sapphire Talisman]] Then go east
and proceed to go down the stairs to the 2nd floor. At the end of the path, there's a treasure that contains a [[Shrimplet]]. When you get back
up from the 3rd floor, there's a small road that leads to a half-circle platform. There's two treasures on both ends. On one end, the treasure
contains [[EP Charge]] while the other contains [[Purging Balm]].

The next adjacent stair is '''Stair C'''. This one leads to a [[Perilous Meatballs]]. Finally, head to the last set of stairs, '''Stair D'''. The stairs lead
all the way down to the 2nd floor. At the end of the path, it leads yet another [[Tear Balm]]. Now, you explored every part of the area in this
path, it's time to tackle the southwestern route.

====Southwestern route====

On the 3rd floor, continue to go straight. On the 4th floor, head north to where the circular platform is and make a right turn. It should
lead to a red treasure on the fifth floor. It contains [[Pearl Earring]]. Then backtrack to the 4th floor and take the stairs on the western end.

On the fifth floor, there is yet another Red treasure on the left side. You'll get [[Ebony Staff]]. Then move up towards the
fountain. There's yet another red treasure northwest of the fountain. You'll find [[Clog Boots]].

Finally, continue to go up the stairs, and it leads to the top floor. If you have Dorothy with you, let her take the photo in the spot pictured below.

^l2|A: Photo spot!

After that's over, it's time for you to go to Jenis Royal Academy.

===Jenis Royal Academy===

|* Stuff to buy          |
| [[Hot-Hot Potato Fry]] |
| [[Royal Gelato]]       |
| [[Young Lady Plate]]   |

After you reunite with Kloe, it's time to talk to several students. First, head over to the girls dormatory. Go upstairs and go
to the first door on your right and talk to Felicity and Reina. Next, head over to academy: schoolhouse and enter the Humanities classroom.
Talk to Mickey to gain insight about the investigation. Then talk to Patrick on the second floor near the bulletin board. Lastly,
you can go to the academy room for nostalgia purposes. Once the sun sets, it's time for you to go back to the student counsel room.
Hans will give to the [[Back Gate Key]]. Now, head over to the old schoolhouse.

====Old Schoolhouse====

|*+2 Chests / Items      |
| 1 | [[Tear Balm]]      |
| 2 | ''All Sepith x10'' |
| -- | [[Rusted Key]]    |

^l13|Old Schoolhouse

Head over to the old school building east of the academy. Along the way, head east on the 1st floor. There should be two doors: a green door where you
cannot open while there's the other door that leads to opening outside. Head to the door on your right. It should have a treasure nearby which contains
an ''Multi-elemental Sepith x10''. There's a spider west of the main building on the first floor. Finally, head up the stairs to the second floor and move west.
Also, there a [[Tear Balm]] on the west side, 1st room from the right. Anyway, walk around the 2nd floor and you'll notice that --u--''one of the torches are
not lit''--u--. Examine the unlit torch and a second hint will be revealed.  Go to the first floor, and head west. From there, go to the first classroom from your right and examine the desk on the upper left corner.
Lastly, head upstairs and enter door on the eastern wing of the schoolhouse. You should arrive at the balcony. Examine the broken stone planter and you should recieve
a [[Rusted Key]]. Once you have the rusted key, go back to the first floor and open the green door.

===Underground Ruins===

|*+6 Chests                                                                            |* Monsters            |

|  6 | [[Feather Brooch]]  |   13 |   [[Teara Balm]]    |   19 |   [[Hard Loafers]]    |   [[Wrap Spider]]    |
|  7 | [[Insulating Tape]] |   14 |   [[Cast 2]]        |   20 |   [[S-Tablet]]        |   [[Mouki]]          |
|  8 | [[EP Charge]]       |-2 15 |-2 [[EP Charge]]     |-2 21 |-2 [[EP Charge]]       |-2 [[Storm Bringer]]  |
|  9 | [[Reviving Balm]]   |

Since this is the "same dungeon", chest numbers start at 3.

|* Area 1 |

^l14| Underground Ruins: B1

The moment you step inside the underground ruins, you'll engage to a boss battle immediately.

=--Boss: Mouki--=

This boss is a heavy hitter and uses a wide area effect arts like Aero Storm. It uses Darkness Breath to blind your ally from a distance, and uses HP
absorb to sap away your ally's health. It also uses Super HP absorb to sap away a significant amount of health once its HP is 33% or below. Its weakness
is Earth and Fire. So, if you have someone who uses earth or fire arts, then they should be the ones doing the attack. Use any crafts that interupts
casting time such as Estelle's Hard Break or Kloe's Sturm. Just watch out for the HP absorb attacks.
=-=

Once you beat Mouki, go forward. We'll call the first intersection, "Intersection A". Head east at "intersection A" then go south on the second intersection.
You should see a room that contains the treasure chest [[Teara Balm]]. Then continue to move south until you find a room on the southernmost end of the area.
There should be three treasure chests in one room. The red chest on the right contain monsters called Puppet Fraggers and you must defeat them. You get
[[Feather Brooch]] after defeating the Puppet Fraggers. You'll also get [[EP Charge]] and [[Shield 1]]. Once you have these treasures, backtrack so that
you'll find the T-intersection. Go east and continue to move forward. You should find a small room on the easternmost end of the map. The chest contains
[[Insulating Tape]]. Then continue to go forward, and you should find EP charge at the very end of the room.

Let's go back to the second intersection, and this time head east. As you move forward, there should be a small room on your left, and you'll find [[Reviving Balm]].
Lastly, you'll find [[Attack 2]] at the very end of the path. Let's go back to "Intersection A" near the starting point. This time, head north. You'll find a
red treasure containing [[Stinger II]]. Keep going straight until you find a large corridor with two rooms facing north and east. The room facing east contains a
[[Teara Balm]] and the room facing north has a chest containing [[Jenis Blazer]]. Finally, go south to proceed to the next area.

|* Area 2|

^l15| Underground Ruins: B2

Descend the staircase and you'll find a monster chest. Defeat the Proxy Fraggers and you'll get [[Cast 2]]. On the next room, you'll fight another Mouki. This
time, it has Proxy Fragger as one of the reinforcements. Be sure to destroy the Proxy Fraggers and let it use Death Throes early on. Eventually, the temporary
buff will wear off and proceed as usual. Anyway, once you defeat Mouki, you'll find a large intersection. We'll call it, "Intersection B". Start by going left.
At the second intersection, go east and you'll find [[EP Charge]]. Go south and you'll find [[Teara Balm]]. Go west and continue to go forward. At the T-intersection,
go west and you'll find [[Zeram Powder]]. At the very end of the path, you'll find [[Reviving Balm]].

Go back to "Intersection B" and head right. At the large room intersection, head right. You'll find a room with a Dust Guist as well as a treasure chest. You'll
find [[Hard Loafers]]. Then go straight until you find another large room intersection where the path goes left or right. Go right and you'll find a Ballbat along
the way. At the end of the path, you'll find [[S-Tablet]]. Then head to the left path and go forward. You should see another intersection: one leads to the recovery
point while the other path leads to a treasure chest containing [[EP Charge]]. Finally, rest up and prepare yourself. You are in another boss battle.

=--Boss: Storm Bringer and Proxy Fragger x4--=

Storm Bringer have Orbal Hurricane which blasts its beam across the battlefield. It unleashes Curse Blade as a melee attack. If that's not enough, it summons
more Proxy Fraggers so that it has more opportunity to gain stat buffs from them. Next, it uses Energy Blast by crossing its blade on the first turn. Then, it
unleashes its energy throughout the battlefield causing devastating damage to your allies. You need to plan out your attacks. If you have earth guard, use that
to prevent any incoming attacks against your opponent. Next, if Storm Bringer is preparing to use Energy Blast, use any attacks that interupts the charging animation
such as Estelle's Hard Break or Olivier's Sniper Shot. This will prevent Storm Bringer do any damage as well as wasting a turn. Inevitably, you do need to get rid
of the Proxy Fraggers so that Storm Bringer will call its ally and waste its turn. Lastly, use S-Craft when you really need it.
=-=

|* Results |
|''5000 Mira''|
|''BP: 5 (+3)'' |

If you did all the other sidequest, you should have ''47/380''
After the battle is over, Kloe and Olivier will join you! This marks the end of Chapter 1, so you should have an achievement, [[Sneaking Shadows]]
signifying that you completed the chapter.

; They definitely don't join for the rest of the game, both leave and make me sad.

After your talk with Kilika, go to Tita's house at the southwest corner of Zeiss.  Now go straight to the
Central Factory and get that gun for Olivier. You'll have basically the entire chapter to do this
sidequest, but be sure to kill 15 monsters eventually. You also might as well get The Stolen Sign out of
the way.

|* Sidequests |

* [[The Stolen Sign]]
** Talk to Kilika.
** Head to the eastern part of town near Zeiss Chapel and examine the the back of the clock tower.
** Go north towards the Zeiss Central Factory and go on the 5th floor. From there, go to Central Factory: Operation room and examine CAPEL in the center of the room. Choose Central Factory,then Universal Tech, and choose Bracer Guild Sign.
** Head over to Forgel Bar, but don't enter it. Instead, examine the three metal chimneys behind the building.
** Finally, go back to Zeiss Central Factory on B1. Go forward towards the loading dock and talk to Faye.
+
* [[New Model Orbal Gun Test]]
** Head to the Orbal Factory. Then go to the Central Factory - Workshop on the third floor and talk to Karl for a [[0-Type Orbal Gun alpha]]
** Win 15 battles while Olivier equips the gun.
** You have basically the entire chapter do this, just be sure to do at least 15 battles by the time you report back to Karl.
+
* [[Training Assistance]]
** Do this immediately.
** At Leiston Fortress, talk to Private Samuel at the front gate. You'll engage in three consecutive battles.
** Be sure to equip items that resists blind and freeze because the soldiers inflict those status effects.
** On the third battle, you'll fight Colonel Cid. Look out for attacks like Flash Strike which inflicts AT delay to your ally or Flying Orders which attack any foes from a distance. Whatever you do, don't let Cid cast Arc Prominence because it's an all-range attack that deals severe damage to your allies. So, use any attacks that interupts casting.
** If you won all three battles, you get two extra BP as well as [[Gladiator Headband]]. This is a very good accessory to have because it gradually increases CP as the battle goes on.

|* Plot |

=--BONUS BP WARNING!--=
NOTE: Before you set off to Wolf Fort to investigate the earthquake, --u--''be sure to go to talk to RUDI on B1 Zeiss Central factory''--u--. When you arrive at B1 of the factory,
go straight forward towards the elevator to Kaldia Tunnel. Talk to Rudy near the elevator, and he'll mention a mysterious man with sunglasses. Believe it
or not, this actually affects bonus BP. Do not miss it!
=-=

After that's over, you need to go the Wolf Fort. If you are playing the Steam version, now it's a good time to take on
[[Odyessy of Anton]]. If you are playing the PSP version, you don't have to do the [[Odyessy of Anton]] because you obviously don't get an achievement for it.
To begin with, he's on the roof of Sanktheim Gate, and yes you need to go out of your way right now and talk to him. He'll
be at that gate for the rest of the chapter.

(Shame for those of you actually doing this achievement, but Drache spoke to him while the achievement was still bugged and she got it immediately.)

^l16| Tratt Plains Road

There's a treasure box on the the eastern perimeter past the signpost towards Wolf Fort. It contains [[Piscis Heart]]. Don't forget that there's a small wooden
treasure right by the tree trunks near the main road and the signppost towards Elmo Village. It contains [[Earthworm]]
If you are going south towards Elmo Village, there should be a treasure box on the perimeter on the southeast corner near the small pond.
Area 2 should be a wide grassfield where it has three possible paths. On the path northeast of area 2, there should be a monster chest. It contains [[Silver Earring]] if you defeat the monster mobs.
If you are doing [[Tratt Plains Monster]], there should be a large monster northeast corner of area 2 close to the perimeter. If you are following
the main road, you should see another red treasure box near the center. It contains Multi-elemental Sepith x10 On area 3 towards
the entrance to Wolf Fort, there should be two treasures. One treasure is on the perimeter on the southwest corner of the map. It contains [[Zeram Powder]].
The second treasure should be near the Wolf Fort entrance right below the tree branches. Be sure to shift the camera to see your view. Anyway, the
the treasure contains [[Softening Balm]].

^l17| Carnelia Tower

(Thanks dragonsstar for correcting errors on the map)

On the first floor, there are two treasures sandwiching between the staircase at the entrance and the stairs to the second floor.
As soon as you come in, shift your camera so that you see the treasure containing [[Reviving Balm]] and [[Teara Balm]]
Proceed forward and you'll find treasures that contains ''All Sepith x20'' and [[EP Charge]]. On the second floor, there's a
red treasure that really isn't far off. Once you  you get [[Ruby Talisman]]. Once you get this treasure, you'll notice that the intersection splits into four paths. Obviously, you
came from the north so we'll focus the other three paths. If you go west, there's a [[Teara Balm]] on the 3rd floor. If you go East, you'll find a [[Seafood Jelly]].

But the real meat of the dungeon is the southern path on the second floor. When you go up to the next floor, you'll encounter a flock of Pumpkin Poms in
front of you. You can hug the walls and hope that they won't chase you or cruise by equipping the Haze Quartz. Anyway, on the 4th floor, go south. Again,
the path will split into three at the circular platform with the two Spiked Jellyfishes. Going east or west, the path will merge on the second floor, but
the path on the south leads to two treasures with a Flame Velgr flying through. They contain a [[EP Charge]] and [[Action 2]].

Regardless on what path you take on the previous floor, the path will merge on the next floor. So, there should be a red treasure box east of the large candle. They contain
[[Accel Gear]] and go few steps south and you'll find [[EP Charge]]. Continue to go straight up to the next area. On the platform where a Flame Velgr lurks by, go south. It should lead to a central platform that has 2 more
Flame Velgrs on it. Anyway, head west and grab that red treasure that contains a [[Five Rings Cane]] on top and a monster They contain Robber Trapper x4. This one is far different from the other robber trappers in the previous towers.
Their formation is spread out to prevent any widespread arts from hitting multiple foes. Also, they will summon a Flame Velger to overwhelm the odds. Anyway,
one the battle is over, you get [[Attack 3]]. Anway, that should be the last of the treasures. There's nothing else to see here, so head back.

on the second floor of the inn. Don't forget to talk to Rufus the innkeeper as well. Finally, talk to Warrant Officer Gerwin on the second floor of the barracks. So,
pretty much you talk to everyone at Wolf Fort.Report your investigation to CWO Pace before you leave.

After you learned what happened at Sanktheim Gate, talk to Warren Officer Talbot at the warehouse. Anyway, when you talk to Warren Officer Talbot, another
bonus BP question will come up. Choose the third option --u--''Both''--u--. Talk to Private Chesely at the rooftop. Before you do that, be sure to Anton again at the rooftop. This time, Anton will get off the rooftop
and stays on the ground with Ricky. This is second of fifteen conversation dialogue for the achievement [[Odyssey of Anton]]. Anyway, after talking to Chesley, talk to
Tammy at the mess hall at ground floor. Once that's over, be sure to talk to Anton again. This time, he will be with Ricky at the staircase near the rooftop. This
is three of fifteen dialogues for [[Odyssey of Anton]]. Anton's mood is at a much bigger slump than before. Anyway, report your investigation to Kilika! Now Tita will join your party and now
have the option to switch your characters.

At the 1st intersection from the Orbal Factory, go south to get [[Frog]] and a [[Mirage Ring]] on both ends. Watch out the one with the [[Mirage Ring]] has a monster chest.
Keep going straight until you hit the bridge towards Air-Letten Checkpoint. Tita will place her device at the end of the tunnel. After a long conversation with your other
companion and Anelace, you can keep going to get the other treasures. On the third area from the two bridges in area 2, go forward. On the first intersection, go south
and you'll find [[Gemini Boots]]. At the 2nd intersection, go northwest and go to every dead ends and you'll find [[EP Charge]], [[Teara Balm]], and [[Deathblow 2]]. You'll
find a large enemy nearby for [[Kaldia Tunnel Monster]]

Not much to see here other than the four treasures that's hanging around the perimeter. There's also a large monster for a sidequest. Anyway, go forward
to Leiston Fortress and talk to the guard. After that, go back to the entrance and have Tita activate her device. After activating all three devices, head
to Central Factory - Operations at Zeiss and talk to Professor Russell. Here's another bonus BP question. Choose --u--''Elmo Village''--u--. Anyway, head over to
the Guild and talk to Kilika.

''95/380''. Anyway, onward to Elmo Village. Before you do that, be sure to go back to Sanktheim Gate and talk to Anton again. Anton will still lie down on the floor
acting all irratated while Ricky will be sitting on top of the crates. This is four of 15 dialogues for [[Odyssey of Anton]].

''Note: The instructions below assume that your camera is facing north. When you hit an intersection, shift your camera so you are facing north''

When you arrive at Elmo Village, your party will talk to Mao. She will give you [[Wooden Gate Key]]. Head north and use the wooden gate key. When you arrive inside the dungeon,
watch out for steaming geysers. If you walk while the geyser is spewing out hot water, you'll lose HP. On the first intersection near the geyser, head south. Keep going straight until
you see a treasure chest right next to Faerie Epitaph. You'll find [[Reviving Balm]]. Go back to the intersection, and go east. When you see another intersection,
go north and keep moving forward. At the end of the path, you'll find another Faerie Epitaph. Behind it lies another chest containing [[Teara Balm]].
Go back to the intersection and go east past the geyser. This will lead to area 2.

On area 2, keep walking until you find another intersection near the red mosquito known as Ya-Kah. Go east and you'll find a geyser that splits into two paths. Go southeast and
you'll find [[Rainbow Surprise]]. Go northeast and you'll find [[Gemini Boots]] at the end of the path. Watch out Ya-kah BTW. Anyway, go back to the intersection. Go south and you'll find a chest containing [[Smelling Salts]]. Then you'll find another intersection
where you'll find another Faerie Epitaph on the north path and a geyser on the south path. Choose the south path and you have to go through two geysers. You'll find a red treasure
at the end of the path where you'll find [[Blue Cashmere]]. Then head to the path where the Faerie Epitaph is standing and proceed forward.

On area 3 where you find the Jet Tortoise at the intersection, go east and you'll find a red treasure box containing ''Multi-elemental Sepith x20''. Then go to the opposite direction;
it should have a narrow path and it leads to a hot spring where you can rest on. At the intersection where Parasite Prima is standing, move southeast. After your conversation with your party members, dip yourself into the hot spring and watch your HP, MP and even
CP rise. Also, there's a red and wooden treasure next to the hot spring. You'll find [[Machine Planker]] and [[Softening Balm]]. Then go back to the intersection and go to the opposite
direction. It should lead to area 4. Prepare yourself for the next boss.

=--Boss: Abyss Worm x5--=
The Abyss worms does two things: Lightning Fall where they cast a bolt of lightning at a distance and a more devastating area of effect called Earth Shaker.
Plus it'll be accompanied with three Parasite Primas. First off, you need to get rid of the Parasite Prima quickly! Next, stay where you are so that the worms
will come closer to you. This will help you do your wide range attacks such as Aerial. After all, wind is the elemental weakness of the abyss worm. Use healing magic
such as La Tear or Lichtkrieis when the Abyss Worms abuses Earth Shaker.

Once the battle is over, you'll have your results. Not only that, Zane and Tita will join your entourage as well. This marks the end of Chapter II. You should have the achievement
[[The Raging Lands]].

^l23| Limestone Cave

Drache hasn't fixed it, but this map has #4 twice. Oops. Thanks to Arty-chan for catching the error! (Among others.)

For the achievement, find all the penguin types. Supposedly this achievement has been fixed (used to
have 10 entries!), but Drache only has 3 as a result of earlier bugs.

Now that you have access to Limestone Cave, you should find a treasure box east from the intersection. You should find [[Insulating Tape]]. Anyway, proceed forward towards
the Limestone Cave. On the first intersection, go east towards the second area. On the second area, head west on the first intersection. You'll find a Green Penguin and a Baby
Penguins at the end of the path. You'll find a chest containing a [[Celestial Balm]]. Now go to the opposite path on the intersection and move
east past the Blue Penguin. You'll find [[EP Charge]] at the end of the path. Then, go north where you found the Blue Penguin, and you'll find a
red treasure box containing [[Lily Necklace]].

Now, go back to the first intersection in area one, and go west. Next, on the intersection with the Orange Penguin, head south and you'll find [[EP Charge]].
Anyway, now go north towards the next area. You'll find It'll lead to a different roadway in area 2. Anyway, in area 2 on the intersection where the shiny
limestone is on the middle of the road, go east and you'll find [[Long Barrel]] as one of the red treasures. Next, move west towards the next area.
In area 3, move southwest at the intersection. You should see two Green Penguins along the way. You'll find a [[River Bug]] at the end of the
path. Then move north and make sure you move west towards the next intersection. You'll find [[Teara Balm]]. At this point, you need to prepare
yourself because you'll fight a boss at the end of the path. I suggest that you equip the Lily Necklace to one of your characters to prevent confusion.

=-----=
''Boss: Divine Penguin''

This battle will start with a surprise attack. Hopefully, Jimmy doesn't get killed in the process. Anyway, Divine Penguin will do
all sorts of attacks that inlicts multiple status effects. For instance, Samba de Penguin inflicts confuse and seal on everyone on the battlefield.
Also, Catfish Dart inflicts moderate damage as well as seal. Next, Swordfish Dart reduces your attack strength. Next, it eats Sardines to heal 999 HP.
Lastly, it charges up for one turn so that it casts Final Halo on the following turn. It deals heavy damage as well as inflicting sleep on your allies.
Dealing with Divine Penguin is bad enough. Having reinforcements is even worse.

As soon as your turn starts, cast Earth Guard on Jimmy before you do
anything else. Next, kill off every monsters on the field before you take on the Divine Penguin. The enemy mobs are a major obstacle to your party members.
If you have Kloe with you, make sure you use Lichtkreis when things get really bad. You may have to use your strong S-Craft early on just to reduce the amount
of enemy mobs on the field. Other than that, do whatever you can to keep the enemy mobs from killing everyone on the
battlefield. Then go all out against the Divine Penguin.
=-=

Once the battle is over, you'll get [[Silver Dew Orb]]. If you have Max BP or finished Secret of the Old Map from FC,
you'll recieve [[Ying-Yang]] Quartz.

Before you go, be sure to talk to
Anton once more at Sanktheim Gate. Anton will be in a panic state and plans to return to Grancel. Yep, you finished
everything in Zeiss. Talk to the ticket booth dude at Zeiss Landing Port and you are off to the next area.

* ''Current Totals''
** BP: 108
** Chests: 123/517
** Drache's guess is perhaps there is a chest that doesn't count, because she came up with 518 chests by the end. It might be the Silver Dew Orb. Dunno!
** It was bugged when she wrote this, give her a break. She still doesn't have the achievement but EVERY LAST CHEST has been opened because she mapped 'em all.
** Follow the guide carefully and you shouldn't have an issue. But your count may be different by one. If there's one thing I'd like you to send a message about, it's this!

Nothing much to see here other than going to Erbe Royal Villa to find a lost child. Before you leave, head to East Grancel and go to the south end of the department store.
Anton and Ricky are hanging out at the staircase. You'll see Anton pondering his life again. This conversation puts you at 3/13 on the achievement for [[Odyssey of Anton]].

In front of the church, you'll see a bunch of pigeons. Those all have breakfast names, and one of them is named Golden Toast. Keep trying to talk
to them till you find it to complete the first part of [[Breakfast Safari]]. This is the only pigeon that is not missable. The other two are, and
one is coming up shortly.

^l31| Grancel Sewers: West

For the time being, let's focus on the section of this area we can reach. Go down the stairs at the entrance. On the B1, continue
to go forward pass the first intersection. When you get to the second intersection, go south. There should be a set of staircase that leads to the
recipe, [[Mystery Paste]]. Backtrack to the second intersection and proceed forward. Continue to move forward
until you are in the room that splits into three paths. You came in from the western room, therefore we should explore the other two rooms.
There's the northern path that has the two torches in-between and the eastern path along with it.  Let's go to the eastern path first. After
you enter the room on the right end of the room, the path should split into two. Go north to get [[Silver Gauntlets]]. Now, go to the opposite
route and it'll lead to a series of staircases. At the end of the path, you'll find [[Edel Armor]].

Now go back to the big room and enter the door with the two torches. There, the path will split into two. Go right and you'll be presented with two doors.
The door closest to your current location leads to a dead-end. Go to the door furthest from the intersection, you'll get another [[Smelling Salts]]. Anyway,
now go left at the intersection and it'll lead to the next area. Go straight until you see an intersection. The one on the left leads to yet another
[[Zeram Capsule]] and the one on the right leads to the monster for [[Grancel Sewer Monster]]. Afterwards, you cannot go any deeper.

(Thanks dragonsstar for correcting errors on the map)

The map is backwards from the text... this is what happens when one person is on maps and the other isn't.

If you start Erbe Scenic Route from Royal Avenue via Sanktheim Gate, there are a couple treasures to get.
If you head north from the first intersection, it leads to a old stone cerulean monument. Northwest of the monument,
there's a red treasure nearby. Defeat it and you'll get [[Deathblow 2]]. As you go south, you'll see another treasure [[Teara Balm]].
Go south of the intersection and you'll see a vermillion monument.  Right behind the vermillion monument is yet another red treasure box, and it contains [[Defense 3]].

Continue to move forward. On the second area there's a deadly monster in the middle of the road. This  is for the sidequest, [[Erbe Scenic Route Monster]].
There's a Royal Villa, but let's get the treasures before we enter. If you go south, there should be an Amberl monument at the end of the path. However,
there's no treasures near the the amberl monument. Keep going forward and go north at the intersection towards the third area.

At the third area, hug along the wall on the right side and go west at the intersection opposite of Romal Pond. You should find a [[Teara Balm]] along the way
That one should have a Virescent Monument. Right by the old monument, there is a treasure which contains ''Multi-elemental Sepith x20''.
You have all the treasures, head over to Erbe Royal Villa.

===Erbe Royal Villa===

| [[Breakfast Safari]] 2/3 |

The second part of [[Breakfast Safari]] is coming up. When you enter the courtyard, head east where a group of children are playing with two pigeons. One of the pigeons is named Eggs.
This is your only chance to talk to Eggs, so do this immediately.

Okay, go inside the villa and a cutscene will occur. Your objective is to find a lost child. After your conversation with Chamberlain Raymond, head west and enter the first room you see
on your left. You'll find Duke Dunan inside the room. At this point, you can look around the villa and search for potential objects that the small child could be hiding such as the bench,
table, large vase, or the podium if you like. Next, head over to the northwest room or two rooms from Duke Dunan's room.  You'll end up at Royal Villa Lounge. If you look at all of the
objects, you'll have an option to give up. However, we want to find her on our own because bonus BP is at stake here.
--u--''Examine the bottles behind the countertop as demonstrated below.''--u--

^l3|Lost Child Location

=--Note--=

First playthrough, Drache got all 7 BP just fine. She explored just about everywhere and did okay.

Second playthrough, she mysteriously got 5 BP, and she isn't quite sure what the difference is. Since the points are only shown at the end of the chapter, she may never know.
Going by the bracer books in both versions, one mentions a table, podium, bench, and pot, whereas the other (with the full 7 BP) mentions a table, podium, and bench -- no pot.
Perhaps she was "too thorough" on the second time around?

Looking around everywhere is a lot of fun. But create a separate save if you want to goof off (and as backup!), and just go straight for Dunan and then Renne without detours.

We've heard from literally a million of you that you shouldn't talk to Raymond at all. This hasn't been verified by either of us, but the advice about the save holds true regardless.
=-=

Anyway, by finding the lost child on your own, you gained extra BP! Head back to the guild at Grancel and talk to Elnan.

* [[The Missing Exhibit]]
** You'll be doing some of this as part of the plot events, but the solutions are simply stated here.
** Head over to the East Block at Grancel and go northwest towards Grancel Landing station entrance. There should be a building on the left side saying "The History Museum." Anyway, talk to the Museum Director.
** At Grancel: West Block, there is a small hosue next to the Cathedral. This is General Morgan's residence. On the second floor, --u--''examine the grandfather clock''--u--.
** Second, go to Grancel: South Block --u--''examine the back of the bird fountain statue near the entrance.''--u--
** Finally, at Grancel: East Block, enter the Calavardian Embassy to the south. Climb the first set of stairs and go to the room on the right. --u--''Read Chapter 15 of Doll Knight''--u-- (and the rest of it too, for an achievement!). It is located at the center bookshelf.
** Go to the Grand Arena, at the eastern end of the map, and be sure to equip anti-freeze accessories.

If you want to get the [[Bamboo Fishing Rod]], go to the North Block and enter the house next to the entrance to Grancel Castle.
Go to the second floor and talk to Norche. She'll giveyou [[Bamboo Fishing Rod]]. Your objective is to go through three locations
representing the neighboring countries: Calavard Embassy, Erebonia Embassy, and Grancel Castle. Grancel castle is located in the
north block while Calavard and Erebonia Embassy are located on the north and south end of Grancel: East Block.

First, enter the Calavard Embassy and let Zane do all of the talking. After entering inside the Calavard Embassy,
ascend the first set of staircase and enter the room on your right. You'll find three bookshelfs on the left side of the room.
This is the start of the achievement [[Blue Knight]]. Read all 22 chapters, and you'll get the achievement. (This achievement
is a bit bugged, so make a spare save file ready) If you have been very diligent with [[The Missing Exhibit]] by finding the
first three clues, you'll find the next hint on chapter 15 of Doll Knight.  Anyway, go to the very top floor and enter the large
door. Talk to Elsa, and your business in Calavard Embassy is done.

Next is the Erebonia Embassy, which lies on the northern end of the East Block.  There's nothing much to see here other than
the Carnelia novel you helped collect on the previous adventure. Speaking of books, [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 4]] is in this embassy.
After you have your talk with the ambassador, Mueller will accompany you to the door. HOWEVER, do not leave because Mueller is your ticket to get
the next volume of Gambler Jack. So, go on the library on the left side of the embassy on the second floor and talk to Nathan.
He'll give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 4]].

Finally, let's head to Grancel Castle. It's located at the north end of the north block. First talk to Hilda, she's found at
the information room. From Grancel Castle entrance, ascend the large staircase on your left and enter the hall on your left as well.
Go straight forward towards the opposite end of the hall. There, you'll find Hilda somewhere in the information
room. After your conversation with Hilda, it's time to visit the queen. From the guest room, go east and continue to move forward. Keep going
straight until you see the stairs. Climb the stairs and keep going foward until you reach the queen's private balcony on the top floor.

If you went to the two embassies and Grancel Castle, the sun is setting.  Talk to Anton again at the staircase near the department store.
Anyway, head over to the west block and go to Liberl News Station next to Baral Coffee House. Go to the top floor and talk to Nial. After
your pep talk with Nial, go back to the Guild House and talk to Elnan. Watch out, another bonus BP question is coming up.
Choose --u--''Wait a minute...''--u--

Next up, you'll see another cutscene near the abandoned mine. The other companion who is with Anelace will take charge against the unknown
assailant. Defeat the Special Ops Soldiers and you'll proceed to the next set of cutscenes. The next day, you'll end up at Erbe Royal Villa.
So, backtrack to Grancel and go to the guild. Elnan will give you the results.

|* Results |
|''3000 Mira'' |
|''BP: 3''|

Don't worry about the missing bonus BP, the results is for the lost letter. Anyway, if you did all the other sidequest, you should have
''123/380 BP''.

After a story event, Tita and your companion will join up with you. Be sure to explore the Grancel Sewers if you want to get
the treasures. Also, don't forget to talk to Anton again near the department store. Also,
be sure pick up [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 5]] by going to Baral Coffee House on Grancel: West Block. Talk
to Connor on the right side of the coffee house. Anyway, we need to find the lost child again. To get bonus BP, we need
to find her ourselves. To make it easier for yourself, I'll tell you the potential hiding spots. So, do the following:

=-----=
*Go to the History Museum at Grancel: East Block near the Grancel Landing Port entrance
*Go to the Grancel Department store and follow Renne
*Go to the Museum again and run to the top floor and walk back to ground floor
*Next, go to Grancel: South Block and head to the Fisherman's Guild next door to Grancel Bracer Guild
**Examine the three portraits of fishes inside the Fisherman's guild on the first floor
*Go to Grancel: West Block and talk to the barista at Baral Coffee House
*Next, go to Grancel: East Block and head to the ice cream vendor on the left side of the map in between the north and south block entrane.
*Finally, go to Grancel Airport, which is north from the ice cream vendor
**After the cutscene, enter the landing port and walk to the airship landing bridge
=-=

When you see Olivier at the landing port, the "lost child" will show up. This means that you have earned bonus BP. Anyway,
it's time to move to Gurune Gate and Estelle will be on her own. Continue to go east until you arrive at Gurune Gate.

Click [[Gurune Gate|here]] to skip past the Sewers stuff and get on with the main story.

^l32| Grancel Sewers: East

On the map, "M?" denotes a monster available in Chapter 8. Drache will figure out its number later.

The location to the sewers is northeast of Grancel: East Block. The guy guarding the door will now let you in.
So, go straight down until you see a split path. If you go left, it'll lead to a
bunch of Scissor Hands along the roadside. The one on the right is much safer. There's a
door that leads east. We'll come back there for now. Continue to go forward until the split path merges, There,
you'll see two doors. Assuming you went to the path on the right, the first door you see will lead to
a red treasure chest that contains ''Water Sepith'' x200. Go to the adjacent door on your left and
you'll find a chest containing [[Red Flies]]. Anyway, backtrack to the door you see on the right end of the map and
continue to move east.

On area 2, go straight until you see another intersection where you'll see a bunch of Boiled Egger O.
At the intersection where there are two wooden bridges, go to the one on your right. It'll lead to
another staircase below. The one that continues to move east leads to a series of stairs. At the end of the
path, it should lead to the monster treasure box and you'll recieve [[Crystal Heels]]. Anyway, go back to the
intersection with  two wooden bridges and go to the opposite path. It should lead to the next area
the moment you enter.

On area 3, go straight until you see an intersection. Continue to move forward from the first
intersection. We'll come back at the same spot later. Anyway, you should arrive at a corridor
with two rooms. The first door nearest from the entrance will lead to a dead end.  If you go on
the second door at the end of the corridor, you'll find a lever. However, you cannot
pull the lever. You cannot do much so, go back to the intersection and head to the first door on
your left. From there, go forward  until you see a copper steel bridge pathway on the left side. This leads
to the monster you are looking for in [[Grancel Sewer Monster 2]]. Don't forget that
you'll find a red treasure at the end of the path and you'll get [[Trickster]].

Next, go back to the intersection where you crossed the copper steel bridge and move forward. You'll
end up at three narrow pathways. The first narrow pathway from the left side is obviously a dead
end. Next, the one in the center leads to Grancel Sewers: North while the one on your right leads to
a chest that contains an food item called [[Got Some Spine]].

===Grancel Sewers: North Block (Optional)===

|*+2 Chests               |* Monsters       |

| 13 | [[Long Barrel II]] |
| 14 | [[Holy Cloth]]     |
| 15 | ''All Sepith x25'' |

^l33| Grancel Sewers: North

Once you arrive at Grancel Sewers: North Block, Keep going forward until you hit a intersection.
Make a quick deotur south because there's a treasure chest containing a [[Teara Balm]]. Continue to go forward, there
should be a red treasure chest containing [[Edel Guarders]] at the end of the path. Now go back to the
first intersection and go forward.

On the 2nd area, where you'll find a Bone Fish at the intersection near the long bridge, go up and you'll
find [[Long Barrel II]]. Keep going forward to the next room. You'll know when you arrive to the next area
due to the unusually long loading time.

On the third area, Before entering the room in the center, continue to move west towards the end of the corridor.
At the end of the path, there's another red chest. However, you'll fight a flock of Black and Pink Sheeps
at the narrow bridge. Keep going straight until you see a red chest at the end of the path. Defeat
the monster mob inside the chest and you'll recieve [[Holy Cloth]].

Anyway, go back to the corridor where there's a door at the center. Keep going straight until you see a staircase.
However, do not climb the flight of stairs because there's a red treasure chest next to the staircase where
Bone Fish is hanging out. This one contains ''all-sepith x25'' That should be the last treasure. Now, you
have to backtrack all the way at the entrance in Grancel Sewers: East Block. :(

===Gurune Gate===
|* Stuff to buy       |*+2 Enemies                |
| [[Shellful Dish]]   | [[Attack Doberman]]       | [[Orgueille]]             |

| [[Anarchy Soup]]    | [[Special Ops Soldier 2]] | [[Port Seeker 2]]         |

At Gurune Gate, head upstairs and go to the top floor. The soldier will tell you to go the south wall. So, head to the
door that leads to the south wall. Keep walking until you see a cutscene. Here's another bonus BP question. Choose
--u--''A Trap!''--u--. You'll fight two drones with Kevin.  After that, go back to Grancel and go the guildhouse.
The other companion will join your party. Anyway, head to Grancel: West Block and head to the port. After fighting
the Attack Dobermann, head to the warehouse. You'll fight a set of Special Ops Soldiers. After that, head to the
harbor and go east. You'll fight another set of Special Op Soldiers. Be sure to save your CP because the next battle
will show up as soon as you vanquished the Special Op Soldiers.

=--Boss: Orgueille--=
Sheesh, its massive size can withstand most physical attacks as well as dealing significant offense against your allies.
Just moving the tank towards your allies deals heavy damage. It has ranged attacks like hellfire or heavy barrage to
deal damage from a distance. When the Orguille is close to death, it'll unleash maximum output to temporary increase
strength and speed. Finally, it charges its beam cannon in one turn and unleashes Orbal Cannon on the next turn. It deals
heavy damage to your allies within its line of fire.

In this battle, Julia will join you in battle. I suggest to use all of her arts and crafts available because they are
high level offense. Anyway, Unless you are using Agate, you are definitely not going to attack head on. Instead, use
small level arts like Aqua Bleed Air Strike or Petrify Breath to deal damage. It's not much, but it'll help you chip
away its health as the battle goes on. You may have to invest on Chain Crafts a lot more than usual because you need
all the help to deal significant damage. It also helps that using Grail Sphere to shield you against incoming attacks.
Other than that, keep grinding away against the tank and you are well on your way to victory. Be careful, you have
another boss battle coming up!
=-=

=--Boss: Kanone--=
First, she'll set off multiple detonating mines throughout the battlefield in one turn. Next, she uses her gun to deal damage.
She'll use Poison spray to inflict poison as well as damage against the nearest allies. She also casts Shadow Spear as well.
Then she has her Spec Ops Soldiers to annoy the crap out of you. If that's not enough, she also has Paralyzing Barrage
to deal stun damage as well as hitting a wide range. Lastly, you have to watch out for her Dancing Barrage which deal
heavy damage against your allies. By then you are really exhausted from the other fight. Do whatever you can to beat
Kanone because your resources are limited. If you are having trouble with the status effects, use Kevin's Sacred Breath
to recover HP as well as removing status effects.

seek events and answered correctly on the bonus BP questions, you should have ''146/380'' BP. After you assembled your
party members, it's time to do some last minute stuff before we leave Grancel. Be sure to talk to Anton once more before you go.
Also, you have one more sidequest to finish up. If you finished the Royal Avenue Monster, you should have ''150/380 BP''.

Now you finished everything, it's time for you to go to Grancel Landing Port and talk to the airport lady at the ticket
booth. Don't forget to talk to Anton and Ricky right by the ticket booth. This marks the end of chapter 3. You should
have the achievement, [[The Mad Tea Party]] signifying that you beat chapter 3.

^l34| Sky Bandit Stronghold

You'll begin the chapter in Joshua's point of view. Go forward until you find an intersection with one room. Go on the room on
your left and you'll engage battle against regular soldiers. Defeat them and you'll get [[Bobcat Ignition Key]]. Next, go to the door
on the very left and you'll find [[Attack 3]] inside the red treasure box. The next room on the right should have two doors: one going
in the middle and the other going right.  Go to the room in the middle and a cutscene will occur. From there, go past through the knocked
out soldiers and go to the next room. There, you'll find [[EP Charge]] and [[Feather Brooch]]. Starting from the intersection, go right
and keep going straight until you hit the corridor that makes a sharp 90 degree left turn on room 7. The room on your right leads to
a dead end, so keep going forward.

On room 9, the room splits into four directions. You came from the room on the right side. Going north leads to a dead end while
going west leads [[Teara Balm]]. Next, go south and go two rooms down and you should see a room on your left. It leads to [[Curia Balm]].
As you go forward, there should be another room right around the sharp 90 degree right turn. [[EP Charge]]. Continue to go forward until
you see the stairs leading to the next floor.

After you climbed the stairs on the second floor, you should see the first room on your right. It leads to [[EP Charge]]. Continue to
go straight until you see another locked room. You cannot do much there, so continue to move forward. On the next room from where Major
Vander is at, go south and enter the room on your left. It leads to [[Teara Balm]]. Then backtrack and enter to the first left door.
You'll find another [[Teara Balm]]. Keep going straight until you hit the horizontal corridor with two rooms. The first one on your left
is another [[EP Charge]] while the other is the empty room. Next, the next corridor with a gold rat on it, go to the first door from
your left and you'll find [[Tear All Balm]] and you'll find [[EP Charge II]] on the adjacent door. Keep going forward and prepare yourself.
''Make sure you have the [[Bobcat Ignition Key]] and examine the ship.'' You'll fight enemy grunts before fighting the next boss.

=--Boss: Major Vander--=

Major Vander is a heavy hitter and have lots of technical moves up his sleeves. The moment you cast your arts, he can interupt you
with Mirage Edge. Next, Ragna bind pulls in one of your allies close to him. Also, hound edge is a wide area of effect which does
heavy physical attacks to anyone within the vicinity. Finally, his most powerful attack is Blade Dancer which deals devastating
damage to your ally.

This battle is not winnable, so do what you can to survive before he starts taking more than two turns. Don't worry, this
battle will not cost you any BP.

''UPDATE'': So, I lied! It's possible to defeat Major Vander. What you need to do is to cast Clock Up EX, and Joshua
must cast it the following turn! Next, you need to watch the AT-Reel carefully! Do regular attacks or use
True Dual Strike to deal damage. If Str. +50% or Critical is on Joshua's turn, use True Dual Strike
because it deals significant damage. Even though it's sounds tempting, do not use S-Craft just yet!
This will give Major Vander additional turns if he survives Joshua's S-Craft. Once Major Vander's HP is
less than 5%, use S-Craft to finish the battle. The whole point of this battle is to monitor
the Bonus Icon on the left side and know when to strike.

You can also use Slyphen Guard to increase evasion and use Clock Down to reduce Major Vander's speed. This can be
very beneficial for those who have trouble fighting him. (Thanks kondeeza.123 for the additional tip)

After your battle at Sky Bandit Stronghold, you are back in the skies. Anton and Ricky are right by you. So, talk to
them when you have the chance. As always, talk to all of your party members before you progress to the game. Once you
have done that, go back to your seat and the next chapter will commence.

After talking to Aina, Scherazard will accompany you for the time being. You will need to go to Elize Highway, West Milch
Main Road, and North Malga to investigate how far the fog streches throughout the region. You will also need to go
to Estelle's house as well. At this point, now it is a great time to do the sidequests. Anyway, head over to the house
next door to Abend Bar and run to the second floor at the room at the end of the corridor. Talk to Serra inside her
husband's private library collection and she'll give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 6]]. Anyway, you have a ton of exploring
to do!

Don't forget to talk to Anton and Ricky at Rolent Landing Port. They are at the landing dock near the airship.

Henceforth, fish once at every single spot you see, to a total of six. And don't complete that sidequest till you've done all six spots.
You don't have to go to Gurune Gate to start this sidequest.

As for the ring, that will be covered several sections down, but go ahead and get thing started by talking to the couple at the Rolent Chapel.

===Malga Trail===

| 3 | [[Teara Balm]]      | [[Flying Feline]]       |

^l36| Malga Trail

On area 1, keep going straight, you should be able to find a [[Reviving Balm]] along the perimeter. On area 2 where you
see the signpost for Malga Mine and Esmelas Tower, go right towards Malga Mine. You'll see a cutscene where you see
the extent of the fog. Even though you are done investigating this area, we're still looking around for more treasures.
Anyway, there you should be a path which deviates towards the east. You'll find [[Teara Balm]] at the end of the path.

Go back to the intersection with the two signpost and go to the opposite direction towards Esmelas Tower. You should
find another [[Teara Balm]] at the small intersection.

For efficiency's sake, Esmelas Tower will be covered later. You can do the ring sidequest there immediately, if you really want,
but you'll be coming back for a monster regardless. So just go back to Rolent.

Be sure to swing by the Bright house for a scene and a fishing spot.

Go south towards Gurune Gate. After the cutscene, we are still looking for treasures. On the second area,
walk on the perimeter on right side towards Rhinocider and you'll find [[Mute]]. Then go forward and you'll
find a wooden treasure chest near the entrance to the next area. You'll find [[Smelling Salts]]. On area 3,
on the left side of the signpost, there is a [[Purging Balm]] in a treasure chest across from the fork towards Mistwald.
Past the intersection towards Mistwald, go south until you find a deadly monster at the Gurune Gate
entrance.

Hidden beneath the tree next to the pond is ''Water and Wind Sepith x100''.

On the second area where there's a pathway towards Perzel Farm, hug the wall up north and walk along the
perimeter. You'll find a red chest containing [[Roaring Thunder]]. Likewise, if you hug the wall and go
southeast, you'll find a wooden chest containing a [[Teara Balm]]. Keep walking along the perimeter towards
southwest part of the map, and you'll find [[Smelling Salts]] beneath the tree folage.

On area 3 towards Verte Bridge, hug the walls and walk along the perimeter towards southeast and you'll
find [[Insulating Tape]]. Keep moving southwest and you'll find a monster chest. Defeat the monster mob
and you'll get [[Scent]]. Now, continue to walk along the perimeter and move north and you'll find
[[Zeram Powder]]. And beat up the Giantfoot right in the middle of the trail!

Be sure to check out the fishing spot at Verte Bridge.

You should have ''161/380 BP'' (though you can have up to 165 if you went to Esmelas anyway). Anyway, it's time to
investigate the people around the area. Before you do that, be sure to go to the top of the Rolent Clock Tower
and talk to Bacon the pigeon. This is the only time Bacon will show up. See the steam achievement, [[Breakfast Safari]]
for more info. Anyway, you will need to investigate the following people. Don't forget to talk to Anton
inside Abend Bar.

* [[Search for the Lost Cat]]
** Do this immediately.
** Talk to Ida at Hotel Rolent.
** At the landing port, talk to Fabree near the airship dock. Then head downstairs and head to the warehosue behind the airship. Skip should be in the cooridor between the warehouse and landing port.
** Quint is not inside the Abend Bar. He's in Melder Orbal Factory right across the guild.
** Finally, go back to the landing port to find Zosimov. Face north and Zosimov is on --u--the first tree on your left near the entrance--u--. After talking to Zosimov, talk to Fabree to look inside the airship. Once you are inside the airship cabin, go to the bottom floor of the airship. You'll find the lost cat.
** If you have max BP or did the sidequest, "Lost Cat" in FC, you'll get [[Master Beads]]



=--Victims--=
* Lita at the mayor's residence (Second Floor, first door from the stairs)
* Tabitha at the Abend Bar (Second Floor inside the bar)
* Luke at Ashton's house (The house next door to Abend Bar)
* Radford near the West Gate (The house behind the Melders Orbal Factory, first floor)
=-=

Once you talk to all of the victims, go back to Aina at the guildhouse. Here's another bonus BP question: choose
--u--''No Witnesses''--u-- and --u--''Luke Collasped''--u--. Once you are in Estelle's house, go downstairs to
progress to the story.

The next day, go to Rolent. ''Before you go to the guild'', you can go to Rinon's General
Goods to buy [[Dark Chocolate]] for additional dialogue. This part is optional, so if you want more character
interaction, now is the time. Anyway, before you head to the farm, be sure to talk to Anton around the
sides of Rolent Guildhouse. Ricky and Anton are facing towards the clock tower.

The location of Perzel Farm is on  Milch Main Road and go south on the second area. Once you are in Perzel's
Farm, you'll fight three Alrunes. They are weak against earth and they are exceptionally evasive against
physical attacks. Anyway, after defeating the Alrunes, go through the backdoor and enter the dining room.
Go to Rolent and report it to Aina.

Return to Milch Main Road and head to where M15 on the map (a couple sections up, if you need it) is for the
remaining two monsters in the list.

Drache has no idea whether this instance "counts" or not, but Anton's dialog changes after returning.

Be sure to have spoken to Armand and Ellie at the Rolent Chapel before coming here, for [[The Ring That Flew Away]].

^l37| Esmelas Tower

You'll note that the "final" number is the first treasure you should encounter. The four towers were among the first maps
made, and the screenshots of the outside came much later.

If you are doing the sidequest, [[The Ring That Flew Away]], this is the place where you will find the ring.
Outside of the tower, you should find [[EP Charge]], as well as a boss monster. After entering inside the tower, proceed to the second floor.
On the second floor, you should be able to find a regular and a red treasure chest sandwiched between the staircase.
It contains ''Water Sepith x200'' and [[EP Charge]]. Along the way, you should be able to find [[Emerald Talisman]]
at the center of the room. Once you have the [[Emerald Talisman]], the path splits into two: east and west path.
Either path is fine because it merges to the staircase towards the third floor.

Keep going straight until you find the staircase to the fourth floor. Before you do that, shift your camera so that
the map icon compass faces north. Once you do that, go west, and you'll find [[Mighty Juice]] at the end of the path.
On the fourth floor, keep going straight until you arrive on the center with a 3 sectioned wall. Go west past the Coral
Shell and you'll end up on the stairs to the fifth floor. Before that, go past the wooden bridge right where the
Pom is standing, and you'll find a monster chest at the corner. Defeat the Robber Trapper and you'll find
[[Gypsy Queen]]. On the fifth floor, keep going straight towards the end of the path and you'll find a red
treasure containing [[Diamond Staff]].

After you have the [[Diamond Staff]], head back to the 3 sectioned wall on the fouth floor and go east. You should
arrive on the staircase that leads you to a different part of floor 5. On the fifth floor, walk along the perimeter
and you should find two red treasures containing [[Shield 4]] and [[Duende Slippers]]. Then keep going forward
past the verdant tree at the center of the fifth floor towards the 6th floor.

At the top of the tower, you'll find a shiny object on the left pillar nearest you. You'll find [[Silver Ring]];
this is for the sidequest [[The Ring That Flew Away]]. After you have the ring, turn it in to the couple at the church and
get on with the plot.

===Mistwald===

^l28|: Mistwald

--u--''NOTE: Make sure your camera is facing north, so you won't get lost!''--u--

At the first intersection, go east and you'll find [[EP Charge II]]. Then go back to the main intersection
go north to the next area! On area 2, there's three log bridges which signifies branched paths. Take
the log bridge on the left side, and you'll find a red treasure box containing [[Wolf's Fang Whip]].
The center and the right log bridge lead to the same path. There should be a [[Celestial Balm]] nearby.
Go east towards the next area, and you'll find a trove of treasures at the end of the path. Be sure
to look at the perimeters, and you'll find [[Survival Vest]],  [[Lily Necklace]], and [[Black Bangle]].
Backtrack to the previous area and move north. At the next area, be sure to hug the walls on your left,
which leads to a path with a red treasure box. It contains [[Haken Boots]]. Continue to move north to
the next area.

After the cutscene, you will be in another area. --u--''Be careful, each time you go through one area,
it counts as one "room". If you failed to find the exit by the 20th room, you'll LOSE BONUS BP!''--u--
So, do the following to get to the next boss. From the initial cutscene go....

=-----=
* Room 1: East
* Room 2: North
* Room 3: East
* Room 4: North (You should hear the sounds of the bell)
* Room 5: North (You should see a cutscene)
* Room 6: East  (There should be a red treasure chest containing [[Range 1]] at the center of the open field. )
* Room 7: North
* Room 8: East
=-=

If you did it correctly, you'll see a cutscene where the culprit reveals itself. Be sure to equip Lily Necklaces
and Black Bangle before you engage into battle. (If you have Master Beads from the cat sidequest, use that as well
because it prevents sleep and confusion)

=--Boss: Jubokko and Zaqqum--=
First off, it'll be accompanied with four Alrune which will use Dream Smoke to interupt art casting. Jubukko
will charge up and use Mist Storm to unleash an all range mist attack which inflicts sleep or confusion.
Jubukko can absorb physical attacks but vulnerable to arts. Zaqqum can absorb arts but
vulnerable to physical attacks. Also, Zaqqum absorbs incoming earth attacks. However, don't fall for that
because he can absorb arts in general. Be aware that Zaqqum inflicts confuse whenever it decides to attack
one of your allies. Make sure you have someone who is a phyiscal hitter who can take on Zaqqum while
you need a dedicated arts user to attack everyone else using earth magic. Be sure to have Olivier along
to use Sniper Shot 2 to do a direct attack against Jubukko whenever it uses Mist Storm. Make sure you do
S-Craft of Zaqqum and not Jubbuko.
=-=

====Illusionary Fog====

After the battle is over, and you took control with Estelle, talk to her parents. After what Cassius has
to say, talk to Estelle's mom outside the house. She'll tell you to grab it from her drawer. So, go
back to Cassius' office and examine the drawer next to the bed. You'll find [[Storage Room Key]]. Then
go upstairs and open the locked door. Once you are inside the storage room, examine the blue treasure
chest near the window. You'll get the [[Harmonica]]. Go to the item menu and use the Harmonica. After that,
talk to Cassius and Estelle's mom one more time then use the Harmonica at the balcony floor. Watch the
a series of cutscenes, and you'll finish this chapter. You should get the achievement, [[The Mist Demon's Target]].


===Post-Chapter IV Sidequests===

|*Sidequests           |* Achievements          |
| [[Nostalgic Recipe]] |-3 [[That Damn Recipe]] |
| [[Diaset's Secret]]  |
| [[Mine Commission]]  |

You have four sidequests to finish up. Once you are done, head to Rolent Landing Port and you'll continue your
adventure.

Be sure to return to Mistwald and go to the Rolent Sewer for the final fishing spots. Then finish up that request at Gurune Gate. If you did not get the [[Metal Trident Rod]],
you missed one. Click [[Fishing Spot Search|here]] for more details.

Since you'll be going to the Sewers as part of a sidequest, there's a small section on it below.

|* Nostalgic Recipe |

Head over to Abend Bar and talk to Densel inside the kitchen. Then talk to
Radford; he should be standing at the counter right next to the bartender. After learning about
some the ingredients, head over to Rinon's General Goods and talk to Bloom on the second floor.
Next, go to the house next door to Abend Bar and talk to Rhett as his private library on the second
floor. Examine the bookshelf on the upper right hand corner of the room for [[Recipe Copy]]. You will
need these ingredients.

|* Ingredient        |*Quantity |* Location             |
| [[Aged Miso]]      |  1       | Rinon General Goods   |
| [[Vintage Wine]]   |  1       | Rinon General Goods   |
| [[Maple Sugar]]    |  2       |  Rinon General Goods  |
| [[Kibbled Salt]]   |  5       |  Rinon General Goods  |
| [[Fresh Herb]]     |  5       | Rinon General Goods   |
| [[Dragon Beans]]   |  2       | Rinon General Goods   |
| [[Black Pepper]]   |  4       | Rinon General Goods   |
| [[Juicy Bone]]     |  2       | Dirty Rats at Rolent Sewers |

You should get the [[Pepper Pottage]] recipe and earn a steam achievement.

|* Diaset's Secret |

Go to the Rolent Clock Tower and talk to Anton. If you are doing the odyssey of
Anton, this will count as another conversation. Anyway, you will need to gather the following ingredients:

|* Ingredient            |* Quantity |* Location                      |
| [[Monster Carapace]]   |     5     | Coral Shell in Esmelas Tower   |
| [[Savory Pinion]]      |     5     | Red Insectos in Malga Trail    |
| [[Prickly Seed]]       |     5     | Mantrap in Milch Main Road     |
| [[Pearlglass]]         |     1     | Fishing spot in Elize Highway, Mistwald, or Milch Main Road |

Assuming that you were diligent from doing the other sidequests in the previous chapters you should have adequate amount of
Monster Carapace, Savory Pinion, and Prickly Seed in your possession. Your main concern is the Pearlglass. It's a large fish
located in one of the three fishing spots. Generally, you have the best chance of catching Pearlglass by using the [[Bamboo Fishing Rod]]
and river snail as your bait. If you do not have it, you may want to use your default rod and use earthworm.
Your chances are slim, but you can tell you caught a big fish if the wait time is much longer than usual. Once you have
all of the ingredients, present it to Anton. After a long cutscene, report to Aina even though she witnessed Anton's
antics. :P

|* Mine Commission |

Head to the houe right behind the Orbal Shop, then go to the second floor and talk to Gaton. EAT MASK BLEUBLANC.

* At the Rolent Chapel, go to the second floor's balcony, where the bench faces the altar. --u--''Examine the red chair next to the door''--u--.
* In the Mayor's residence,  --u--''examine the five boxes on the south wall''--u--.
* Behidn Elger's Arm and Guards, --u--''examine the dirty forge below the iron shed.''--u--
* Use the Rusted Key at the locked door in Rolent Sewers. You'll find a bunch of Moukis. After defeating them, examine the wooden cabinet next to the fire torch. You'll find [[Ore Mine Commission Letter]].
* Talk to Gaton and he'll reward you x500 Sepith of your choice.

* ''Totals Before Going to Bose''
** BP: 212
** Chests: 187/517

|-2 2 |-2 [[Confuse]] | [[Moth Cluster]] |
                      | [[Mouki 2]]      |

^l35| Rolent Sewers

To get to Rolent Sewers, go behind Rolent Church on the southeast corner of the map and examine the sewer grate.
If you played FC, this is the tutorial dungeon! Anyway, nothing much to see here other than two treasures and
a fishing spot for [[Hidden Fishing Spot]] sidequest. You should see the fishing spot right away. Next, you'll
find [[EP Charge]] at the second intersection to your right. Next, go to the very end of the path and you'll
find a monster treasure chest. Defeat the monster mob and you'll get [[Confuse]]. Beyond the locked door is a mob
of Mouki, so beware.

==Chapter V: That Which One Must Protect==

Once you finish your business with Rolent, get on board with the Airliner Cecilia. As always, talk to all of
your party members. Please note that if your characters participated in the battle against Jubukko and Zaqqum,
they will get extra dialogue involving their dream experiences inside the illusionary fog. Simply talk to them
again after their initial conversation.

===City of Bose===

|*Sidequests                               |*  Stuff to buy          |

| [[The Rarest Flavor]]                    |

You got a lot of ground to cover. Three of six sidequests are mandatory, and you must finish those three
before you progress to the story. Because the first part of chapter five are sidequest missions, we well
cover Krone Pass, Nebel Valley, and Amberl Tower on the next session. If you missed [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 6]]
in Rolent, now it's your chance again to get it at Bose Market.

* [[Imperial Request]]
** In the North Block, go to the second floor of the Frieden Hotel and talk to Jerrold.
** Behind the Orbal Factory in South Bloock, take the stairs toward the balcony and --u--''examine the red flower pot''--u--.
** On the third floor of the Guild House, --u--''examine the opened book on the table.''--u--.
** At the Airport, --u--''examine the large crate on the forklift near the warehouse.''--u--
** Finally, at the Bose Chapel go to the private room on your left and --u--''examine the bible on the altar.''--u--.

For [[The Rarest Flavor]], talk to Gwen in Anterose's kitchen. If you don't have all the ingredients already, click the link.
Before you give up the ingredients, however,  --u--''talk to Orvid near the south exit of Bose Market''--u--. This will award bonus BP.

You should start [[The Missing Lady]] at the Anterose right now, as you're headed in that direction for the next couple sections.

===West Bose Highway===

|*+2 Chests                 |* Monsters          |

                            | [[Rock Pecker]]    |

^l40| West Bose Highway

On the first area, you should be able to find a [[Teara Balm]] along the main road. On the second area,
walk along the perimeter on the south rim of the map and you should find a chest nearby. It should
contain a [[Softening Balm]]. On the third area, which is going directly to Krone Pass, walk along the
north rim of the map and you'll find an [[EP Charge]].

===Krone Pass: Bose Region===
|*+2 Chests                 |* Monsters            |

| 4 | ''Earth Sepith x200'' |-2 [[Blade Fang 2]]   |
| 5 | [[EP Charge]]         |

^l41| Krone Pass

The first treasure chest should be very easy to spot. You should find a [[Tearal Balm]] on the mainroad.
At the second area of Krone Pass, you should see a monster at the intersection.

=-----=
''Boss: Blade Fang x2''

It uses Roar to increase its Attack and Defense. After it uses Roar, their normal attacks deal severe
damage to an ally. However, it'll feel extremely hostile and backs off occassionally. Overall, it
is an easy battle. Have someone heal the wounded ally while someone else uses Chain Crafts to deal
damage. :)
=-=

After you defeat the Blade Fangs, go south at the intersection and you'll find a [[Reviving Balm]] right by the tree.
Also, Just before the bridge after the Blade Fangs in Krone Pass, to the north there is a chest with [[Curia Balm]] by the Queen Scorpion.
Continue to walk forward past the wooden bridge and walk along the perimeter on the south end of the map where
the cliffs are facing south. You should be able to find a red treasure box containing ''Earth Sepith x200.''
Keep going forward and you should see a wooden chest containing [[EP Charge]].

(Thanks dragonsstar for correction for Curia Balm)

====Krone Pass - Checkpoint====
|*Misc. Treasures           |
| [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 7]] |

Not much to see here other than finding Private Mikey at the first room from Krone Pass. He'll give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 7]].

If you are doing [[The Missing Lady]], Felicity is on the room to your left. Make sure you say --u--''You are really a coward, Felicity''--u--
for bonus BP. You'll be warped back, so be sure to get the book first.

===Nebel Valley===

                              | [[Ice Pecker]]      |

^l42| Mapping Hell. A couple personal least favorites are still to come, but this is the worst. Does anyone read the captions?

You'll note a bridge on the map that doesn't exist yet. You'll be coming back later.

To get to Nebel Valley, you need to go east towards East Bose Highway. Keep going east until the intersection saying Nebel
Valley is up north. Once you arrive at Nebel Valley, make sure your camera is facing north as I explain the directions to you.
On the first intersection go left. Keep going forward until you hit the second intersection. At the second intersection
go south and you'll find another split path. Take the path where it has the wooden bridge. There you'll find a red treasure
box containing ''Water Sepith x200''. Then take the path where it goes through a series of tunnels. At the end of the tunnel,
you'll find a treasure chest containing [[Luck]] quartz. Now go back to the second intersection and go north where you'll
fight a major boss.

=-----=
''Boss: Ghost Epitaph x3''

The Ghost Epitaph will act strange and hit itself. It'll occassionally use Formic Acid which inflicts light damage with
petrify. It also does Stalagmite Drop to deal moderate damage. Honestly, this battle is pretty easy if you stay out
of the enemies' range. The Ice Peckers will cause more trouble than the Ghost Epitaph, so use your usual attacks.
Don't forget to cure petrify if any of your allies got hit by the status effect.
=-=

Even though the battle is over, you need to go right at the first intersection to get the other treasure box. This
will lead to area 2. Anyway, at the intersection of the 2nd area, go north. If you go east, it'll lead to a
log cabin. You rest up there and resume your journey. Anyway, continue to move forward until you
find another intersection with a Giantfoot on it. Go north again, and you'll find a monster mob inside the treasure chest.
Defeat the enemy mob and you'll find [[Evade 4]]. If you continue to move forward, it'll lead to the Sky Bandit Stronghold.
However, you cannot enter there. Anyway, on to the next area to Amberl Tower.

====Eisen Road (Optional)====
|*+2 Chests             |* Monsters     |*  Stuff to Buy     |

^l43| Eisen Road

You should find this road as you walk along the East Bose Highway. Anyway, Not much to see here other than
hanging around the perimeter of the area as you walk along the road to Haken Gate. You'll find
a [[Reviving Balm]] on area 2 on the right side while you'll find an [[Earthworm]] on the left side near
the entrance to Haken Gate.

While at Haken Gate, be sure to buy that food.

^l44| New Ansel Path

You should see the first wooden treasure chest at the main road. It contains a [[Teara Balm]]. They next treasure chest
is hiding under the tree right by the green jellyfish like monster name Mad Roper. You'll get [[Softening Balm]]. On
area 2, you should see another wooden treasure near the main road again. You'll find another [[Teara Balm]]. At the
intersection, head west towards Amberl Tower. You should see another treasure chest behind a rock. You'll find a
[[Reviving Balm]].

Be sure to buy those items at Valleria SHore while you're in the area. Onward to Amberl!

^l29| Amberl Tower

At the base of the tower, look at the tree on your right. You'll find a [[Celestial Balm]]. Next, hug the wall to your right
and walk along the perimeter. You'll find [[EP Charge II]] on the side. On the first floor, go straight forward.
There should be two treasures sandwiched between the staircase to the second floor. You'll find [[EP Charge]]
and [[Poison]]. On the the 2nd floor, go straight until you hit a circular platform in the center.
Head southeast to get ''Water, Earth, Fire, and Wind Sepith x50''.  Then go back to the circular platform and
go east which leads to the 3rd floor.

On the start of the 3rd floor, there's three paths along the perimeter. Before you do that, there should be two
treasures on the side. Be sure to look behind you to see the two treasures. Anyway, they contain [[Reviving Balm]]
and [[Curia Balm]]. Go west and it'll lead to the center of the platform, and the treasure contains [[Topaz Talisman]].
Go north and you'll find two more treasures: [[EP Charge]] and [[Surprise Cookie]]. Go south at the intersection
and you'll find another two treasures: [[Tearal Balm]] and [[HP 4]]. Now, go back to the circular platform where
you found the Topaz Talisman and move west. You should find [[S-Tablet]] and [[Teara Balm]] at the end of the
path. There should be three staircases that lead to the fourth floor.

You'll arrive at the fourth floor depending which route you take on the fourth floor.
On the staircase that has EP Charge and Surprise cookie at the north intersection, there should be a [[Reviving Balm]]
nearby as well as [[Gladiator Headband]]. The staircase that has Tearal Balm and HP 4, go upstairs and you'll find
[[EP Charge]] and [[Curia Balm]]. If you go to the staircase where it has S-Tablet and Teara Balm on the third floor,
you'll end up finding a bunch of Amber Turtle at the circular platform. However, at the end of the path, you'll
find [[Refresh Jelly]], [[Teara Balm]], and [[Phantom II]]. For Phantom II, you have to defeat the monster mob.

Anyway, go back to one of the staircases on the 4th floor and the path will merge on the fifth floor. The
path will merge the moment you see the large Topaz crystal at the center of the platform. At the center of
the platform, you'll find [[Long Barrel II]], [[Proxy Puppet]], [[Star Rabbits]] and [[Ebony Shoes]]. The
Ebony Shoes has monster mobs on it. Proceed forward to the rooftop, where you'll have to fight the next
monster.

=-----=
''Boss: Octobone x4''

Its regular attack inflicts HP absorb and it casts Meteo Storm which deals multiple hits to its victim.
However, it'll move suspiciously and inflict confuse on itself. Like the previous battles, use your
strong attacks and hit them where it really hurts. If it divides itself, kill off both of them quickly.
You should be okay.
=-=

===Bose: After the Monster Sidequests===
Assuming that you killed all three monster at Krone Trail, Nebel Valley, and Amberl Tower, another
BP bonus question is coming up right way. Choose --u--''The Monsters were Afraid''--u--. Anyway
go back to the guild and talk to Ludgran.

|* Results |
|''15000 Mira'' |
|''BP: 6 (+3)''|

After doing all of the sidequests plus the monster extermination, you should have ''238/380 BP''.
As soon as you finish your report, a major event is about to occur. The next bonus BP question is coming
up. Choose --u--''Organize First''--u--. After the incident, Tita will be your companion. Time to
head over to Ravennue Village. Go to West Bose Highway and go north towards Ravennue Village.

===Ravennue Trail===

^l45| Ravennue Trail

When you arrive at Ravennue Trail, there should be only one treasure on the main road. You'll find
[[Smelling Salts]] along the way.

====Ravennue Village====

As soon as you enter the village, head to the orchard and talk to Elder Reisen. If you examine the
large gravestone at the cemetary at the northeast corner of the village, you get additional
dialogue. Be sure to buy up the inn's food. Anyway, head to the abandoned mine.

====Ravennue Trail: North====

On the first intersection, go right to grab treasure chests. On the second intersection, go southeast
to get [[Byakko's Claws]]. Go northeast to get ''Fire Sepith x200''. Finally, go northwest to grab
the other two treasure chests that awaits you at their respective paths. You'll find a [[Reviving Balm]]
and [[Teara Balm]]. Next, go back to the first intersection and go left towards the second area.

At the second area, go north at the first intersection and you'll find a [[Reviving Balm]] at the end of the path.
Then go north at the second and third intersection and you'll find [[Smelling Salts]] at the end of the path.
Finally, go northeast towards the Abandoned Mine.

(Thanks alocervancouver for the correction)

===Abandoned Mine===

|*+2 Chests                   |
| 1 | [[EP Charge II]]        |
| 2 | [[EP Charge]]           |
| 3 | [[Roe]]                 |
| 4 | [[Tearal Balm]]         |
| 5 | [[100 Victories Steak]] |

You'll come back for that sixth chest in a bit.

^l46| Abandoned Mine

At the first intersection, turn right and move north towards the second intersection. You should be able to find
[[EP Charge II]] at the end of the path. Then go back to the first intersection and make a left. As you go to
the second intersection, the path towards the wide open field is blocked off. So, you need to go around
by taking the wooden bridge on the left side of the intersection. On the third intersection, it should
split into three paths. Go southwest and you'll find an [[EP Charge]]. On the fourth intersecion, go west
and it'll lead you to two treasure chests: [[Roe]] and [[Tearal Balm]]. Next, go to the intersection
and continue to run north until you find a treasure at the end of the path. It contains [[100 Victories Steak]].
Finally, move forward to the next area.

After what happened at the abandoned mine, Tita and Agate will leave your party for a little bit. Go to Agate's
house which is west of Elder Reisen's house. After talking to Tita, it's time for you to go back to Bose. The
next day, head over to Bose International airport and go to the landing dock.


====Airship: Ariselle====

Talk to Commander Morgan, Julia, and your party members. Once you have done that, you'll proceed to the next
cutscene. After you take control of Estelle, head outside to see another series of cutscenes. After that,
Tita and Agate will return to your party.

|* Stuff to Buy             |
| [[Liberl News - Special]] |

The shop you need is at the hotel.

To get to the Ancient Dragon's Dwelling, you need to go to Nebel Valley. Go right on the first intersection towards to the
2nd area. Anyway, at the intersection of the 2nd area, go north. If you go west, it'll lead to a
log cabin. Talk to Whelmer to assess the situation. You rest up there and resume your journey. Go back to area 1 and turn
left at the intersection. Keep going west until you see Whelmer at the log bridge. Alright, this is the start
of the new dungeon.

(You can do a sidequest, but for efficiency it's better to do it later.)

===Ancient Dragon's Dwelling===

|  6 | [[EP Charge]]                 |

^l47| Ancient Dragon's Dwelling

Keep going straight until you hit the intersection where the Ghost Epitaph and Blade Fang are standing. The path splits
into two. Go north and you'll find two treasures at the end of the path. You'll find [[EP Charge]] and [[Buster Gear]].
Go back to the intersection and go southwest, it'll lead outside. As you past the Cryon Bits, there's a small cave along
the way. You'll find [[Ebony Shoes]] and [[Teara Balm]]. Keep going forward until you find another cave.

On area 2, there should be a small stream at the intersection. Go North and you'll find [[EP Charge]] and [[Aerondight]]
at the end of the path. Next, go back to the intersection and go west and you'll find [[Rainbow Surprise]] at the
northern perimeter. From there, head south towards the next area. You'll see another cutscene before you resume
your quest.

Go straight forward until you hit another cave. On area 3, keep going straight until you find a large body of
water with octobone on it. At the first intersection, go north to find ''Earth and Mirage Sepith x100''. From
there, go south which leads you to the outside area of the dungeon. When you are outside, keep going west
past the large cave and go to the small cave at the very end of the path. You'll find [[Revival Balm]],
[[Tearal Balm]] and [[Misty Veil]] inside. Now, go inside the large cave and an important battle will
commence.

=--Boss:Ragnard--=

Ragnard has an exceptional range for obvious reasons, so no matter where you go, you will get attacked somewhere.
Also, it moves itself to one of the edges of the battlefield throughout the battle. Next, it flaps its wings
to drag your allies to the edge of the battlefield. Right when Ragnard's health is close to 45%, it'll begin
to use its tail to attack you. Also, it casts Pressure Explosion which causes devastating damage on the battlefield.
Contrary to Ragnard's size, the battle is pretty easy. It's very suspectable to physical attacks and gets
hurt significantly by Chain Crafts and S-Crafts. If you have someone be the bait and cast Earth Guard at the
center of the battlefield, Ragnard will keep attacking the ally at the center. Keep everyone at good health
and you should be good to go.

After the big battle, this marks the end of chapter V. You should have the achievement stating that you beat
chapter five.

If you have done everything up to this point, you should have ''272/380 BP''. Lugran will also give you
[[Overnight Ticket]] as well. You have ton of work to finish up before you head off to Valleria Lake.
First, head over to Nebel Valley and talk to Whelmer and he'll give you [[Dark Stew]]. Watch out, this
is the only time that you'll ever learn [[Dark Stew]], so get it before you set off.

While you're in the area, over to Haken Gate and talk to Carlos. He should be standing right
by the gate, and he'll give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 9]].

Next, talk to Cecile at Bose: South Block. She lives right across Sein's Arm and Guards. Then go to
Valleria Lake, and make sure you talk to Kuwano near the pier southwest from the entrance. Then go back to
Bose and talk to Cecile. She'll give you [[Lakelord II]].

Start up [[Merchant Escort]] (the house is right next to Cecile's) and work your way toward Ravennue
to knock out three sidequests. While the merchant is with you ''don't enter a single encounter'' for bonus BP.

You'll be facing the monster along the trail after you arrive, and finally you'll do a hidden quest, [[Mine Extermination]]
at the mine, where you'll be picking up the sixth chest of the area, [[Crimson Eye]]. Refer to the map
[[Abandoned Mine|here]] if you need it. Refer to [[Ravennue Trail|this section]] for the monster location.

* [[Mine Extermination]]
** Talk to the Royal Army Soldiers at the Abandoned Mine. These little drones are very easy to spot. They should be the only ones roaming around the Abandoned Mines.
** The first drones are on the very right side of the first intersection.
** The second drones are located on the left side of the first intersection close to the wooden bridge.
** The third drones are on the very left side of the area past the third intersection.
** The fourth drones are located in a small cave past the large opening where your party first encounted the dragon.
** The fifth set of drones are located on the very right side of the large opening.
** You should get a message telling you you're done. Report this back to the Royal Army Officers, and the mission is done.
** Don't forget to get the [[Crimson Eye]], which is found on the south perimeter of the large opening!

Before moving on, talk to Lewey at Ravennue Village. He should be standing right by the inn with the other
children. He'll give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 8]].

Finally, all that's left is [[Memories of Distant Days]]. Talk to Corna on the first floor of Kirshe Bar.
She'll give you a [[Photograph of Raini]]. Now go to the Mayor's residence, second floor, and present it
to Lila, then Maybelle.

* ''Current Totals''
** BP: 272
** Chests: 253/517
** Recipes: [[Golden Risotto]], [[Corner Castella]], [[Refresh Jelly]], [[Flame Tongue Stew]], [[Rampage Fish]], [[Roast Fish]], [[Fevered Gaze]], [[Paradise Cooler]], [[100 Victories Steak]], [[Dark Stew]]

====Valleria Lake: Kingfisher Inn====
Once you have all the necessary items, head over to Valleria Lake and enter the Kingfisher Inn. Be
sure to say ''Party Time'' and you'll progress to the next part of the story. I have to warn you,
if you have some business to finish up, finish it now. After a series of
cutscenes, head outside and go to the pier southwest from Kingfisher Inn. Kevin will be your
companion for the rest of the chapter.

^l48| Lakeside Laboratory, Part 1
^l49| Lakeside Laboratory, Part 2

Head inside the lab from the backdoor and you'll fight a group of drones. Get out of the conveyer belt room
and go south. From there, keep going south until you see two rooms at the end of the corridor. You'll find
[[Buzzer]] in the room to your left. Keep going straight until you come across a room with three doors and
the lights dim in light green color. You cannot go the room on the bottom. However, examine the lever and
it'll open the door to the front gate. Anyway, you need to proceed forward rather than going outside.
On the next corridor, there's another room past the intersection on your right. You'll find the treasure
with an enemy mob. Defeat them and you'll get [[Windlass]]. Anyway, go back to the corridor and you cannot
enter the room with the Red and Green locks on them. The only room you can go to is the room on the very
right and the next room at the end of the corridor. Go to the room in your right and you'll find [[EP Charge II]]
From there, go north and proceed to the next room.

On the next room with three doors, go right and you'll find [[Defense 4]]. Then go back to the small room
and go straight. You'll end up in a huge floor saying 1F. Go the the room on the very left. You should see
a recovery point right next to you. Keep going straight until you see the door highlighted in red. The
next boss is straight ahead.

=--Boss: Grant--=
He uses Grant Special to attack your ally with AT Delay. He uses Whirlwind Blade just like how Estelle uses
True Hurricane except it sends your allies towards the edge of the battlefield. That's pretty much it, except
Grant is accompanied by two drones. This battle is not hard, just conserve your CP and defeat it through
brute force.
=-=

At the end of the battle, examine the computer and you'll posess the [[Red Cardkey]] which gives you access to the red doors.
Coming from the left door, you should see a door with the red key slot on it. Use the Red CardKey and you'll have access to
the next floor. If you decide to go to the room with the Red and the Green key slot, the red door leads to extra story dialogue.
There are no treasures there. Anyway, head to the elevator that leads to the 2nd floor.

On the second floor, there's a door with the blue key slot on your left while there's a door with the green key slot on your
right. You can't go to any of them, so your only choice is going south.  On the next room, go right and you'll find [[EP Charge]]
at the end of the path. Then go south and go straight for the next couple of corridors. On the next corridor, you should see
a small door on your right. Go there, and you'll find [[Night Goggles]]. Keep going straight until you find a corridor that
stretches horizontally. Go right and you'll end up in the room with six sleeping capsules. At the center, you'll find a
treasure chest that contains a [[Teara Balm]]. Then go to the opposite path and you'll end up in a room with a bunch of capsules.
On the next room, you cannot go to the room in front of you because you need a green key card. Anyway, equip the night goggles
and traverse through the dark labyrinth. If you run to the right side wall of the labyrinth, you'll find [[Ebony Shoes]]. If you
find the door on the left side, you cannot open it because you need the Blue card key. So, continue to go straight. You'll
fight another boss in the next room.

=--Boss: Carna--=
She uses Grenade Shot for simple area of effect attack to your allies. She use Shock Web to intrupt anyone who is casting arts.
Finally, she uses Heavy Armor Piercer to deal damage while decreases your ally's defense. She has the blue drones that deal
damage from one end of the battlefield to another. She also have a wide range of attacks like Combination Assault: alpha and
beta, and scattershot deal damage against your allies. First, get rid of the blue drones quickly by using arts. Then overwhelm
Carna with your attacks.
=-=

After the battle is over, head to the computer again and you'll get [[Green Cardkey]]. Now, go to every Green door you see.
You'll find [[Star Rabbits]] on the first green door. The second green door is the balcony view of the broken Storm Bringer.
The third green door is the elevator to the third floor. Before you do that, take the elevator back to the first floor and
enter the green door next to the red door. You'll find [[Misty Veil]] inside the room. Go back to the second floor and
use the Green Card key to open the green door on the right. This will lead to the 3rd floor.

On the third Floor, going to the door on the south leads to the mysterious blue orb. There should be a treasure chest
on the upper right corner containing [[Naptime Cookie]]. Once you have the naptime cookie, it's time to turn back and
go west from the elevator room. Keep going straight until you hit the corridor with the door on the center left, center right and the one
at the very end of the path. At the center left, you'll find a door with the blue key slot. Make note of that. The room on
the center right leads to the Storm Bringer room, but there's a treasure at the end of the path. Defeat the enemy mob and you'll find
[[Attack 4]]. Anyway, go straight at the end of the corridor. You'll be in the large room with the Gospel at the center. There's a
treasure on your left. It contains [[Tearal Balm]] and [[Teara Balm]]. The treasure at the southeast corner of the room contains
[[Ebony Suit]]. Keep going straight, and you'll find the next boss.

=--Boss: Anelace--=
You should know how she works since you used her on prologue except with so much damage output. Just watch out for her
S-Craft towards the very end of the battle. Also, watch out for the red and blue drones. Keep your allies healthy, and you
should be good to go.
=-=

After the battle is over, go to the computer and you'll get the [[Blue Cardkey]]. Let's backtrack to all the blue doors we've
found thus far. On the third floor, at the corridor with the center left on the side, go straight and use the Blue Card key at
the end of the path. You'll find ''Time, Space, and Mirage Sepith x50''. Then take the elevator back to the 2nd floor and
go to the room to your left. You'll find ''Wind Sepith x200''. Then go to the dark labyrinth and enter the door on the left
side of the room. You'll find ''Fire Sepith x200''. Finally, go to the first floor and go to the conveyor belt room and
head to the room on the upper right corner by the entrance. You'll find ''Earth Sepith x200''. You should have all of
the treasures in this area. Time to hightail to the rooftop. From the elevator, go straight and then rest at the recovery
point. The next boss awaits.

=--Boss: Doppelganger x3--=
You basically fight 3 Joshua Robots which uses all of his moves from FC. Most of them deal devastating damage especially
his S-Craft Black Fang. You may want the doppelgangers to bunch up together so that you'll have the opportunity to
deal area of effect arts as well as Chain Crafts. If you can use Kevin's Grail Sphere at its maximum potential, your
allies will be immune to damage for two hits. This will give you breathing room to heal up or set up stat buffs for
your ally. Beat this quickly or else the Joshua robots will continue to spam crafts and Black Fang attack.
=-=

After the battle is over, you'll take control of Kevin. Continue to move forward...

^l50| Glorious, Forecastle
^l51| Glorious, Stern 1F
^l52| Glorious, Stern 2F

You'll take control of Renne while you take the grand tour of the Crimson Ark. Look at two of the rooms on the right
side because each of them have a treasure chest. It has [[Knockout Meatball]] and [[EP Charge II]]. After that, go
to the elevator and run to the long corridor.

After a series of cutscenes, you take control of Estelle once more. Head out and go to your right. At the room
with the elevator that led to the Professor, enter the door southwest from your current position. At the corridor,
enter the third room. It'll have the treasure chest that contains [[Tearal Balm]]. Head to the elvator that
leads to the first floor by going straight north.

On the first floor, you need to get around the electical barriers. So, you can either go to the north or
south door to get around the barriers. However, I recommend to start off taking the north door and walk
up the stairs. You should arrive in the red corridor. Keep walking straight until you hit the electrical
barrier. Right by the barrier is a door to another room. Enter the room and you'll find three treasure
chests: [[Curia Balm]], [[EP Charge]] and [[Vajra]]. Anyway, continue to move around the barrier
until you get to the opposite end of the corridor.

When you arrive at the large exit at the tail end of the corridor, make sure you enter the small door southwest
of the corridor. This will lead to a small red door which contains a treasure chest [[Misty Veil]].
At this point, you want to prepare yourself, so do any last minute adjustments because you want to win this next battle.

Ideally, you must have all of the elemental Orbals at the highest level. (i.e. EP Cut 4, EP 4, Action 4, Attack 4,
Sepith Vein, Heaven's Eye and etc.) However, I assume that most of you do not have a godly set-up and you guys
are roughly around level 60-67. That's alright! Before you walk towards the large exit, make sure you have
these items with you. Also, be sure to have 200CP ready before you set off.

*[[Buzzer]]
*[[Emergency Puppet]]
*[[Naptime Cookie]]
*[[Knockout Meatball]]
*[[Zeram Powder]]/[[Zeram Capsule]]

Anyway, I will explain why you need these items for the next boss battle. When you go out, you'll be presented with
three choices. Choose --u--''...Mayor Dalmore's former steward''--u--. This next part decides whether or not
you'll get bonus BP.

=--Boss: Gilbert and Enhanced Jaegers x4--=

''BP WARNING: YOU MUST WIN THIS BATTLE TO GET BONUS BP''

''First off, your time against them is very limited. If Estelle dies or the battle ended at a stalemate,
you will lose bonus BP.'' So, you need to win this battle. Anyway, Gilbert and the Enhanced Jaegers all have similar movesets.
Accel Charge will deal damage to Estelle without moving a single step. Next, Heavy Smash deal heavy damage
and uses grenade to deal moderate damage against Estelle. Gilbert on the other hand will deploy mines and
shoot from a distance. Next, the Enhanced Jaegers use Max Guard to guard themselves against any incoming
attacks. Finally, the Enhanced Jaegers will use Impact Rage to deal heavy damage while taking steps
towards Estelle.

This battle requires a bit of luck. Make sure you have Buzzer or any equipment that prevents faint. This
will help you win the battle quickly. Next, if you see any critical bonus on the AT-Reel, use S-Break
to deal damage. This will kill one of the soldiers on the battlefield. If you have to use S-Break with
the critical icon bonus on it, use S-Break against Gilbert. Consequently, this will give additional turns
to your foes. You better pray that the Enhanced Jaegers will bunch up together. If that happens, use
Naptime Cookie to deal heavy damage as well as putting them to sleep. This will give you breathing room
to do other attacks. Also, if your Knockout Meatball can target more than one person within the line,
use it as well. This will make them faint and the Enhanced Jaeger will have to forfeit their turn.
This is very important because anytime if one of the enemy's ally is injured, one of the Jaegers
will use Reviving Balm or Teara Balm to heal their wounds. If they fainted or asleep, this will
prevent them from attacking or healing themselves.

If you want to increase your chances to win the battle, equip the Emergency Puppet. The reason why
you want to equip the Emergency Puppet over the Proxy Puppet is because the Emergency Puppet will
fully restore your health as well as gain 200CP the moment Estelle dies in battle. This will
give you the opportunity do deal heavy damage. Zeram Powder or Capsule will also give you
more CP whenever you have a turn, but don't know what to do with it. With a bit of luck and
deal a significant damage in a short amount of time, you can win this battle.

(This strategy is catered to people who did not invest their time on their orbal set-up. I want to hear how you won this battle)
=-=

After the battle is over Joshua will join your party. Go forward towards the stairway where the Enhanced
Jaegers came out. From there, use the recovery point to heal yourself. On the next room, go south
and walk up the stairs. On the first floor, go past the red drone, and go south. Keep going straight
until you hit the room with a treasure chest containing [[Star Rabbits]]. Then backtrack to the
room with two doors and go north. Keep going north until you hit the corridor with a hint of red
lighting. When you arrive to the "red" corridor, go to the adjacent door. You'll find a treasure
chest with a monster mob. Defeat it, and you'll find [[Seven Rings Cane]]. Continue to go forward
until you get to the opposite end of the corridor. You should see another recovery point.

On the next floor, go straight at the intersection because the other two paths are shut tight.
Then you are at the corridor once more. Go south and walk up the stairs. At the next corridor
past the Port Seeker, go south until you find the red door at the end of the path. You'll
find [[Proxy Puppet]]. Then go back to the corridor where you found the Port Seeker and
move forward a few steps until you see the door on your upper right. Keep going straight
up until you find the corridor with a hint of "red" lighting. Go to the adjacent room
to the left and you'll find ''All-Sepith x100''. You have all of the treasures, so
head to the corridor at the opposite end to your right. Enter the door and you should
descend the staircase. If you did it correctly, you should end up at the platform right
next to the large mechanical robot called Vanguard. Head inside at one of the doors
and take the elevator to the hangar. Obviously, you'll fight the boss at the end of the corridor.

=--Boss: Pale Apache--=

It charges on the first turn to use Break Cannon the following turn, which does heavy damage
plus a defense debuff. It does Bullet Barrage to deal minor area of effect damage on your
allies and calls its allies on certain turns. That's pretty much the extent of this battle.
Make sure Joshua casts Death Scream on the first turn to wipe out the weaker enemies while
Estelle acts as support. If Pale Apache uses Break Cannon, move out of its trajectory and
attack. Then do your usual strategy plus Joshua's useful crafts. Be sure to get your last
hit by doing a long range attack. That way, you'll prevent devastating damage from self-
destruct.
=-=

After the battle is over, Joshua will now join your party for good. This marks the end
of Chapter VI. You should have another achievement signifying your completion.

==Chapter VII: Tetracyclic Towers==

After a series of cutscenes, Cassius will present your results. By defeating Gilbert
in battle, you should have ''281/380BP''. Also, Olivier will leave your party for a while.
So, once you have everything ready, talk to Faye at the Cargo room and let her hoist
you down to the tower.

Pardon the order of the maps; the second altered space doesn't play nice with the other sections and I'm
limited to a measly 750 x 500...

* '''''NOTE'''''
** All monsters are missable for the entire chapter.
** If you want to fill the book, don't leave the dungeon till you've found 'em all.
** The Shining Pom can also be found at Amberl, if you don't stumble into it here.

Go straight until you see a treasure chest containing [[EP Charge II]]. Enter the telporter and
proceed to area 2. On area 2, go left at the first intersection and then go south at the second
intersection. It's a little hard to see, but move south regardless. You'll find [[Smelling Salts]]
at the end of the path. Then, go back to the first intersection and go south. Proceed forward until
you come across a chest containing [[Glam Choker]]. Keep going forward until you hit an intersection.
At the intersection, go northeast and you'll find [[Caledfwlch]]. Then go southeast and you'll find
[[Reviving Balm]]. Finally, go southwest and hop on the teleporter to area 3.

On area 3, go left and stand on the teleporter. You'll find two more teleporters to deal with and
you should stumble ''five'' treasures at the end of the path. Be sure to examine the northeast
corner and look for the "!" sign because your view is obstructed from the platform above. You should
find ''Wind, Time, Space, and Mirage Sepith x100'', [[Reviving Balm]], [[Curia Balm]], [[EP Charge]],
and [[Regina Guarder]]. Go back to the beginning of area 3 and go to the right.

Keep going straight until you hit an intersection with Guard Minion J and S-J Series Doom. Go north and you'll find
a series of teleporters. At the end of the path, you should find five more treasures. You'll find
[[Tearal Balm]], [[Celestial Balm]], ''Wind Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100'',  [[Tear All Balm]]
and [[Blue Falcons]]. Go back to the intersection with Guard Minion J and S-J Series Doom and go west.
You'll find a monster chest. Defeat them and you'll get [[Taiji Garb]]. Keep going straight until
you'll stumble another treasure which contains [[S-Tablet]]. Then, you'll find another teleporter
which leads to area 4.

On area 4, you'll see a treasure right next to the teleporter. You'll get [[Emerald Talisman]]. Next,
read through the dialogue and you'll get [[Data Crystal 0]]. The next part, you'll find two paths.
It does not matter because it's a loop. So, go either northwest or southeast and walk the loop. You
should find [[Data Crystal 1]], [[Data Crystal 2]], and [[Data Crystal 3]]. Once you have those
three, go south where you found Data Crystal 3 and proceed from there. You should see a treasure
chest next to the teleporter. You should find [[8 Divinations Garb]]. Anyway, proceed to area 5.

At area 5, go straight until you find the intersection with five S-J Series Doom swarming around.
Go east and you'll find a trove of treasures. You'll get [[Nohval Blade]], [[Insulating Tape]],
''Wind Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100'', and [[EP Charge II]]. Then go straight forward
until you find the recovery point. Another boss battle will commence.

=--Boss: Bleublanc (Enforcer X) and Balancing Clown--=

Balancing Clown will use Marionette to deal light damage and saps away 30CP and inflicts
stun or seal It also use Pitfall to inflict AT-Delay to one of your allies. Next, Bleublanc
use Shadow Cast to create clones of himself. Bleublanc will use Wild Card to inflict
a random status effect and use Akashic Rain to deal wide area of effect damage on your allies.
Once Bleublanc's HP is close to 50%, it'll unleash its S-Craft, Death Magic. Lastly,
Bleublance summons reinforcements anytime one of the Balancing Clown dies.

You may have to concentrate your attack towards Bleublanc because he'll summon another
balancing clown at any moment. Use Joshua's Abyss Fall or Death Scream to wipe away all
of Bleublanc's clones. Other than that, just use S-Craft and Chain Craft to deal damage.
=-=

After the battle is over, you'll head back to the Ariselle. You'll now go to Carnelia
Tower. Professor Russell will tell you that you can upgrade your Orbment slot to level
3. Anyway, go to the Cargo Room and talk to Faye to proceed to the next tower.

| [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 10]] (After Carnelia) |

^l55| Carnelia Tower: Altered Space A
^l56| Carnelia Tower: Altered Space B

Zane will be one of your mandatory party member in this dungeon. Anyway, at the start
of the dungeon, you will be presented with seven treasure chests. You'll get
[[Reviving Balm]], [[EP Charge]], [[Smelling Salts]], [[Purging Balm]], [[Tearal Balm]],
[[Celestial Balm]] and ''Fire Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100''. Proceed to
area 2 at the end of the path.

On area 2, go to the path on the right and you'll find [[EP Charge]]. Then go to the
left path and go straight. Before you go to the teleporter in front of you, keep going
forward at the end of the path and you'll find [[Curia Balm]]. Go on the teleporter
to the third area.

On the third area, there's two paths: inner circle and the outer circle. You will
come in the third area inside the inner circle. Go southeast and the path will lead
you to the outer circle. When you arrive the outer circle, there are four Data Crystals
from each compass points to find. You should get [[Data Crystal 4]], [[Data Crystal 5]]
[[Data Crystal 6]] and [[Data Crystal 7]].

Anyway, go back to the intersection at the inner cicle near the teleporter and go northwest. Then take
the stairs on the next intersection and you'll find three treasure chests. You'll
find [[Suzaku Bow]], [[Genbu Shell]], and [[Reviving Balm]]. Go forward and you'll encounter
a teleporter at the center of the room back to area 2.

On different part of area 2, go southeast and you'll find four treasures containing [[Softening Balm]],
[[Insulating Tape]], [[EP Charge III]] and an enemy chest. Defeat the enemy mob and
you'll get [[Ruby Talisman]]. Next, go northwest and you'll find another teleporter
at the end of the path. You'll end up in another part of area 3. So, grab the two
treasure you see in front of you, and you'll find another [[Curia Balm]] and
''Fire Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100''. Then grab two more treasures
[[Celestial Balm]] and [[Tearal Balm]]. On to the next teleporter.

On area 4, there are a series of intersections. The first one with two Guard Minion C, go
northeast. At the intersection with Broken Piece C and M-C Series Doom, take the stairs
to the teleporter. You'll end up in the room with two treasure chests [[Taiji Garb]]
and [[EP Charge II]]. Go back to the first intersection with two Guard Minion C, and
go northwest. Step on the teleporter and it'll lead you to three treasures: [[Celestial Balm]],
[[Tearal Balm]], and [[Blue Falcons]]. Go back to the intersection with Broken Piece C and M-C Series Doom
and go down the stairs and take the teleporter. It should lead you to the next area.

On area 5, there's three paths. Go east and you'll find [[Zeram Powder]]. At the same intersection
go southwest and descend the staircase. You should find an M-C Series Doom at the intersection.
Go northeast at the intersection and find the "!" point. You'll find a treasure chest containing
a monster chest. Defeat them and you'll get [[Long Barrel III]]. At the same intersection, go
southeast and you'll find [[EP Charge II]] at the end of the path. Go back to the first intersection
where you found the teleporter.

At the first intersection at area 5, go southeast and keep going straight until you find the
intersection with Guard Minion C and M-C Series Doom. Nab the treasure chest containing
[[Tearal Balm]]. Then go south and you'll find your first level 3 quartz: [[Sapphire Gem]].
Head southeast and descend the staircase, and you'll find another intersection with
Broken Piece C and M-C Series Doom. Go southeast and you'll find [[Yin-Yang]] quartz.
Go west at the intersection and you'll find [[Tearal Balm]]. Go south and you'll ascend
the staircase to another intersection.

You should end up at an intersection with Broken Piece C. Go southeast and you'll find
[[Tear All Balm]]. Next go west towards the last intersection. You'll find another
[[Tear All Balm]] north of the intersection and [[Proxy Puppet]] northwest of the
other intersection. After that, go south at the last intersection where you will
find a recovery point and fight another boss.

=--Boss: Walter (Enforcer VIII) and Steel Cougar x3--=
Steel Cougar will use Wind Blade as it moves around dealing damage to anyone
within the trajectory. Next, it'll use Cleave Shot to deal damage plus inflicting
faint. Walter will use Sonic Shot to deal heavy damage to anyone surrounding him. Next, Walter
will use Infinity Combo and Sonic Shot to deal heavy damage. Finally, Walter will unleash his
S-Craft, Ultimate Blow which deals devastating damage plus inflicts faint to
anyone within a medium circle.

Since you have Zane in your party and if he's adequately leveled, you should have this move
called "Thunder God Kick" which deals heavy damage within the small circle. If your opponent
is crowding together, Zane will deal more than one hit. For instance, if Walter and three
of the Steel Cougars are bunched up, Zane's Thunder God Kick will deal up to four hits
for each of the enemy inside the target range. If you buff himself with True Distend,
he can deal substantial damage. If you are playing the PC version and you were able
to pull this trick, you'll wipe away 75% of Walter's maximum health because the damage output
for Zane's Thunder Kick for the PC version is roughly around the level of a full power S-Craft.
If you are not able to pull this off, then do your usual tactics with S-Craft at the right
moment or Chain Crafts. It's not like Walter is a hard boss to begin with.

=--Gambler Jack WARNING--=

After the battle is over, you'll proceed to the next tower. Once you are in the Ariselle,
be sure to have Kloe with you so that when you arrive at the balcony at the tail end of
the Ariselle, talk to Antoinne the cat. He will give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 10]].
Remember, get this book as soon as possible.

I will further assume that you need to buy [[Liberl News - Issue 9]] from the the ship's shop.
I'm not quite certain because I'm editing this way after the fact.

You know what? Map maker objects. This place is a straight line! Watch out for chests
7 and 14, they have monsters, and make double sure to get the last treasure before taking
the warp.

In this battle, Scherazard will be a mandatory party member. On the first area, go
straight forward until you find the teleporter at the end of the path. On area 2,
you'll find six treasures layed on the side and a bunch of enemies on the center.
You'll find ''Water Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100'' , [[Insulating Tape]],
[[EP Charge]], [[Smelling Salts]], [[Celestial Balm]], and [[Tearal Balm]]. As you
progress towards the Data Crystal, you'll fight Gundoll B. Defeat the Gundoll and
examine the Data Crystal and you'll get [[Data Crystal 8]]. Then go to the teleporter
at the tail end of the corridor.

On area 3, examine the treasure at the center. You'll fight an enemy mob. Defeat them
and you'll get [[Avenger]]. Next, you'll find another platform with four treasures at
the corner. You'll find [[Celestial Balm]], [[EP Charge II]], [[Curia Balm]]
and ''Water Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100''. As you approach to another
Data Crystal, you'll find another enemy mob. You'll find [[Data Crystal 9]].

On area 4, you'll find [[Dragon's Fang Whip]] at the first platform. On the second
platform, there's three treasures in the center. You'll get [[Reviving Balm]]
[[Tearal Balm]] and an enemy mob. Defeat them and you'll get [[8 Divinations Garb]]
Then you fight another enemy mob before getting [[Data Crystal 10]]. Then go on
to the next teleporter.

On area 5, go behind the teleporter, and you'll find another level 3 quartz called
[[Ruby Gem]]. Contrary to the previous bouts, there are no monster mob. So, feel
free to grab [[Data Crystal 11]]. On the next platform, you'll be presented with
six treasures. They are: [[Tear All Balm]], [[Softening Balm]], [[EP Charge III]],
[[Reviving Balm]], [[Sapphire Talisman]], and [[Regina Guarder]]. Go to the recovery
point and you'll fight the next boss. Before you do that, be sure to grab the treasure
behind the boss teleporter to get [[Master Beads]]. Be sure to equip any anti-confusion
accessories such as Master Bead or Lily Necklace. You are going to need it.

=--Boss: Luciola (Enforcer VII)--=
This won't be an easy match because Jubukko, Zaqqum and Alrunes are back as well.
They will employ the same strategy they use against you back at Mistwald.
Luciola unleashes Tempest Dance to deal heavy damage to everyone. Also, she uses
Firestorm to deal fire elemental damage at long distance. Each of her long distance
attacks pushes you back a bit.

In contrast to your encounter in Mistwald, you hold an advantage because Joshua
is with you this time. At the beginning of the battle, make sure Joshua casts
Death Scream immediately. This will help you get rid of the Alrune very quickly.
The strategy for Jubukko and Zaqqum remains the same.

Make sure you have someone who is a phyiscal hitter who can take on Zaqqum while
you need a dedicated arts user to attack everyone else using earth or time
arts. Do not use S-Craft against Jubukko. Once you kill Jubbuko and Zaqqum,
you can kill off Luciola very quickly.

When you embark on the last tower, you get to choose two other party members.
--u--''I STRONGLY RECCOMEND BRINGING KEVIN ALONG ON THE NEXT DUNGEON''--u--.
His Grail Sphere will help you immensely against the upcoming boss. Anyway, on
the first area, go straight until you find a teleporter at the end of the path.
There should be two treasures sandwiched between the teleporter. They contain
[[EP Charge III]] and [[Reviving Balm]]. On area 2, go south and you'll find
[[Tearal Balm]]. Continue to go straight until you find a treasure chest containing
[[EP Charge II]].

On area 3, you'll find a treasure chest containing [[Skull Pendant]]. Continue to
go forward and you'll find [[Tearal Balm]] along the way. On area 4 go to the
teleporter towards area 5. At area five, you'll find another level 3 quartz called
[[Emerald Gem]] as well as ''Earth Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100''.
After getting the Sepith gems, the path will split into two. Take the right path
and retrieve the information [[Data Crystal 12]] and [[Data Crystal 14]], but do
not go to the teleporter. --u--I'm saying this because the next instruction will assume
that you took the left path. So, go back to the treasure chest where you found the
sepith gem and take the left path.--u--

====Altered Space: Left path====
Go left and retrieve data information from [[Data Crystal 13]] and [[Data Crystal 15]].
There will be a teleporter that will lead to another part of area 4. You will see
a ton of intersections, so follow carefully. At the first intersection with D-A Series
Doom, go south. Then go west at the second and you should see a treasure chest on
the left side. It contains [[Tempest Cannon]]. If you keep going south, you should
find a teleporter at the southwest corner of the map. However, we are not going there
yet.

So, keep going east, and you'll find [[Topaz Talisman]] and [[Tear All Balm]] along the way.
When you hit the intersection with Broken Piece A, go north and turn west past D-A
Series Doom. You should see a treasure containing [[EP Charge II]]. Go north from
where your at and you should see a treasure chest containing [[Celestial Balm]].
From where you are at, this is close to the starting point, So go east back where
you found D-A Series Doom near EP Charge II chest and go north. You'll find a teleporter
at the north end. This comes from the right path getting the Data Crystals on the
previous floor, so let's not go there. Go east and you'll find an enemy
mob chest at the end of the path. Defeat it, and you'll get [[Lebensborn]]. This should
be the last treasure chest on this route. From there, the path will split even more.
There's the teleporter on the southwest and southeast end of the area. Ultimately,
the paths will merge at the boss area, and if you are trying to get all 517 Treasure
achievement, you have to go to the other path as well. For your convenience, I have
written two mini-walkthroughs for this segment of the walkthrough.

The --u--''southwest teleporter is right by where you got the Tempest Cannon''--u--
while the --u--''southeast teleporter is right by where you got Lebensborn.''--u--

=-----=
''NOTE: The next segment of the walkthrough will have the same set of treasures
but in different order. It all depends which route you take on area 4. If you decide
to take [[Altered Space: Southeast Teleporter]], click on the link. Otherwise, read
the next segment if you decide to take the Southwest Teleporter.''
=-=

====Altered Space: Southwest Teleporter====
Anyway, on area 3, you'll find [[Cloak]] and you'll find another teleporter along the
way. On area 2, there's a treasure chest where Broken Piece A and M-A Series Doom are
hanging out. You'll get ''Earth Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100''.
Go, west and you'll find [[Zeram Capsule]]. At the end of the west path, you'll find
another [[Taiji Garb]]. Go back to the intersection where you got the Earth Sepith gem.
Then go north until you find the treasure chest where M-A Series Doom and Guard Minion A
are hanging out. You'll get [[S-Tablet]].

On the next area, you'll find [[Curia Balm]] along the way. Then go through the teleporters
again. On area 5, you'll find [[Tear All Balm]] where S-A Series Doom is standing. Also,
you'll find [[Arhat's Staff]] along the way. The path will merge, and you'll find the boss
teleporter. However, you are not going there yet. You are going have to get the treasures
from the other route in reverse order.

Keep going left to nab all of the treasures. You'll find [[Celestial Balm]] and [[Insulating Tape]]
along the way. Then you'll go through a series of teleporters. On area 3 on the opposite route,
go right and you'll find another [[Celestial Balm]]. On area 2, you'll find [[Curia Balm]]. Right
where M-A Series Doom and Broken Piece A are standing, grab the [[Mirage Ring]] and go north.
You'll find another [[Tear All Balm]]. At the end of the path, there should be a cluster of
enemies. You'll find [[Blue Falcon]] inside the treasure. Next, go back to the intersection
where you found the Mirage Ring and go east to hop on the teleporter. On the next area, you'll find
''Earth Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100''. This should be the last treasure chest. So,
click on [[Altered Space: Boss Battle]] for the next section. DO NOT read the Altered Space: Southeast
Teleporter because you've gone through the entire segment.

====Altered Space: Southeast Teleporter====
On the next area, you'll find ''Earth Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100''. Stand on the teleporter on
the opposite end. On area 3, right where M-A Series Doom and Broken Piece A are standing, grab the [[Mirage Ring]] and go north.
At the end of the path, there should be a cluster of enemies. You'll find [[Blue Falcon]] inside the treasure.
Next, go back to the intersection where you found the Mirage Ring and go west. You'll find [[Curia Balm]]
along the way. Next continue to move west and hop on the teleporter. Go left and you'll find another [[Celestial Balm]]
and you'll find another teleporter. On area 5, you'll find [[Celestial Balm]] and [[Insulating Tape]]. Keep going
right until you see the boss teleporter. However, you are not going there yet. You are going have to
get the treasures from the other route in reverse order.

Keep going right to nab all of the treasures. You'll find [[Arhat's Staff]] and [[Tear All Balm]] along the
way. After a series of teleporters. On the next area, go south and you'll find [[Curia Balm]] right where
Guard Minion A is standing. Go on the teleporter and you'' proceed to area 3.'' On area 3, go south and
you'll find [[S-Tablet]] right where M-A Series Doom and Guard Minion A are hanging out. Keep going south
until you see another treasure chest containing ''Earth Sepith x300, Time, Space, and Mirage x100''.
Go, west and you'll find [[Zeram Capsule]]. At the end of the west path, you'll find
another [[Taiji Garb]]. Go back where you got the Earth Sepith and move south to the next teleporter.
You'll find [[Cloak]]. This is the last treasure. Go back to the boss teleporter where you'll fight
the next Enforcer.

====Altered Space: Boss Battle====
Assuming that you got all of the treasures, recover your health and take on the next boss. I hope you
brought Kevin and have at least 100CP ready because the next boss will start off with a bang. Plus,
bring Anti-Petrification accessories along. Also, set Joshua's S-Break as Black Fang to deal damage to everyone
on the tactics command.

=--Boss: Renne (Enforcer XV) and Vogel 911 EX x6--=
The battle will begin in a suprise Battle. She'll unleash her S-Craft Rennede at the start of the battle
dealing devastating damage to everyone. Also, the Volgel 911 EX will spam Gorgon Laser to deal moderate
damage to already crippling allies on the battlefield. If that's not insulting enough, it'll inflict stone.
As a result, you might die before you get to your turn. If you survived the first round onslaught,
Renne will use Blood Circle which is basically True Hurricane with substantial knock back. Finally
she'll use Calamity throw to deal moderate damage at long range.

As soon the battle starts, DO S-Break Immediately on Kevin and Joshua. Kevin should have Grail Sphere set
while Joshua uses Black Fang to deal damage to everyone. The whole point of doing that is to survive the
first turn! Once you got past the first turn punish Renne substantially with Death Scream and S-Craft.
Her defense and HP is pitful and you should beat her very quickly. Watch out, you'll have another battle
coming up imeediately.
=-=

=--Boss: Pater-Mater--=
Despite of its size, it's only going to use two attacks: a regular attack and a thrust attack which
deals heavy damage. That's about it for Pater-Mater. It's so slow that you can overwhelm Pater-Mater
with arts! Spam away your arts and S-Craft to kill off a mobile suit, lol!
=-=

After the battle is over, this concludes Chapter VII. Onward to Chapter VIII...

* ''End of Chapter Totals''
** BP: 290
** Chests: 394/517

==Chapter VIII: Land of Chaos==

So, after learning what happened, Ludgran will give you your results for the previous chapters. At this
point, you should begin the chapter at ''290/380BP''. This is it! You are going to get the last 92BP on
this chapter, and we are going around Liberl to help everyone in need by delivering Zero Field Generator (ZFG). However, you
cannot use your arts for the rest of the chapter. Also, Kloe along with Kevin will leave your party for a while :( So, you are going
to be in a major handicap throughout this chapter.

If you want to use arts, you need to equip [[Zero Field Generator]], and you only have four of them available.
Also, if Tita is in your party, you have to equip the ZFG in order to use Tita's cannon. Lastly,
--u--''Each time you enter the Bracer Guild in Ruan, Zeiss, and Rolent, you will have to forfeit
the Zero Field Generator!''--u-- Also, you may need the ZFGs in order to take on the hidden sidequests throughout Liberl.

''NOTE: Even if you did not enter the Bracer Guild, you can do the monster sidequests without accepting the offer.
This is a useful tibit because you may want to hold on with the ZFGs for certain monster quests! LASTLY, you can
go to the Liberl regions in any order! You need to deliver the ZFGs at Rolent, Zeiss, and Ruan Bracer Guild!''

Yep, if you have any fish to catch, now is the time. Drache hates fishing so the list isn't comprehensive.
Except Ruan's, because Berserker handled that. And I'm serious about the last chance; once you
turn in all the Zero Field Generators, you're basically locked out of a lot of stuff. Especially in the
Grancel region; the plot will move forward there.

Okay, some of the quests recycle the same titles as the previous ones. This is why we differenciate from
the other sidequests! Anyway, we got several stuff to do before moving on to the next region! First,
take on the monster quests! Click on the link for more details. Next, you can get awesome accessories
by going to the top of the towers throughout Liberl. Defeat the enemy, Dimension Bug and Weatherseed
at the top of the roof of Amberl Tower and you'll get [[Shield Orb]]. Next, head over to Valleria
Lakeshore and do a bit of fishing! If you use Heavy Trident Rod and use [[Salmon]] or [[Trout]], you'll get [[Dynatrad]].
Get this fish and Lloyd will give you [[Master Fisher Card]]! This will give you access to their
[[Fisherman's Guild]] Store in Grancel.

Finally, go to Ravennue Village and talk to Sting right by Emilie's General Goods near the entrance.
Enter a door somewhere and come back out! That way, you'll trigger another conversation with Sting!
However, you can only trigger this conversation if defeated Dimension bug somewhere on one of the
towers (most likely Amberl if you have been following this FAQ). Anyway, this should be all the activities
here at Bose. We'll come back here before the end of Chapter 8. As you enter the checkpoint to the west
end of Krone Pass, talk to Ray and he will give you [[Aurora Ball]]. Onward to the next region...

Roubine River refers to the city of Ruan itself.

Chances are, you probably did [[Gull Seaside Way Monster: Redux]] on your way to Ruan. That's very good!
Anyway, deliver the Zero Field Generator to Jean! Next, he will tell you that check out the neighboring
areas while you are in Ruan. This will trigger the hidden sidequest, [[The Occupation of Jenis]].

On your way to Jenis Academy, you'll engage battle against two Blade Cougars! Don't forget to protect
Mickey.

Joshua will infiltrate the school on his own. Examine all of the windows
throughout the the perimeter of the school. Be sure to get a conversation from Hans and Jill
before you go. Take the back gate towards the Old School House and you'll reunite
with your allies. Your next mission is to rescue all the hostages. Here are their locations:

|*-2 Clubhouse      | Girl's Locker Room         | Deborah, Ms. Wiola, and Ms. Millia  (You'll get Mighty Essence along the way) |
                    | Boy's Locker Room          | Mr. Effort and Mr. Ratio |
|*-4 Schoolhouse    | Dean's Office              | Dean Collins and Fauna |
                    | Humanities Classroom       | Jill, Hans, Kaden, Alice, and Purity |
                    | Natural Sciences Classroom | Gerome, Patrick, Dennis, and Reina |
                    | Social Sciences Classroom  | Logic, Argyle, Monika, and Thelma |
|* Boy's Dormitory  | Lower Right Room           | Roy, Rhody, and Janitor Parkes |
|* Girl's Dormitory | Lower Left Room            | Nikita, Taylor, and Felicity |

After rescuing everyone on the list above, it's time to rescue Richelle. She's located at the
old schoolhouse at the back of the academy. You'll engage battle against Gilbert. Honestly, this battle
is such a joke. While Gilbert employs the same tactic against you back in Chapter VI, he does
everything at a comical matter.

Now that you've completed the sidequest, go to the Humanities Classroom inside the academy and go
talk to Purity. She'll give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 12]]. (If you are worried about Vol. 11, don't
worry about it! We'll eventually visit Rolent soon. So, don't fret :D).

Next, bring Tita and go to
Joan's Arm and Guards and speak to the weapon shop owner. She'll give you ''Cannon Impulse F'', which
is an upgrade to her previous S-Craft.

=--Ramblin' Gambler Achievement--=
There are three basic requirements to getting this. The first is that you have read all the Gambler Jacks.
You're almost there.

On top of that, you'll need to gamble. A lot. You'll need a 4 of a kind in poker and a 21
in blackjack. Good luck; it can be miserable.
=-=


Once you finished that, it's time for you to go to Hotel Blanche
and go to pier where the ferryman will take you to the south side of town. Head over to Sapphirl Tower
and you should see a monster standing in your way. From there, go to the top of the tower and fight
Dimension Bug. You'll get [[Mind Orb]] after getting rid of Dimension Bug. After that, head over to
Kaldia Tunnel to enter Zeiss region.

===Liberl: Zeiss Region===

Yep, didn't do a lot of fishing here personally.


Before you enter the Kaldia Tunnel, be sure to equip the Night Goggles to any of your strong
physical hitters. Also, equip Cloak as well because you will be bumping to a bunch of enemies.
Because you are traversing through the dark tunnels, you will not have a minimap, you will have
to walk along the perimeter. Also, be sure to fight the Divine Penguin at the tunnel at the eastern
end of Kaldia Tunnel. You'll get [[Divine Cross]]. Massive stat boost for most parameters
except range.

^l30| Divine Penguin location

After getting the Divine Cross, enter Zeiss. ''Before going inside the guild,'' I suggest you take on
[[Tratt Plains Monster: Redux]]. You'll fight against eight Abyss Worms and they are a pain even with
all your setups. While you in Tratt Plains Rd., head over to the rooftop of Carnelia Tower and fight
the Dimension Bugs. You'll get [[Power Orb]].

Anyway, head over to Zeiss Bracer Guild and talk to Kilika. You will relinquish one of your ZFGs.
She'll inform you that the hot springs pipes has malfunctioned. This will trigger the hidden sidequest,
[[Hot Spring Restoration]]. --u--''Bring Tita along for this sidequest''--u--. Head over to Elmo Village,
talk to Mao twice at the Maple Leaf Inn, and choose to help her anyway. You'll get the [[Pump Shed Key]],
which unlocks the building near the entrance to the Hot Springs Cave. Time for some walking around,
consider equipping Clock and Night Goggles.


* Head back to Zeiss and go to the Landing Port. Talk to Gustav, who is wearing the orange jumpsuit with blue hair.

* Go to the Zeiss Bracer Guild and talk to Kilika. She'll call the folks at Leiston Fortress.
** (Thanks Sandfish95 and shingekinoeigo for the info. If you are playing the "Evo" version, it should be the same thing)

* Next, head to Tratt Plains Road, and head over to the wide open field towards Carnelia Tower.
** There should be a large ship parked at the middle of the field. Talk to Captain Hoffman.

* Once you have the [[Combustion Engine]], go to Zeiss Central Factory at the basement floor and talk to Rudi
** Chief Murdock will come in and give you his letter

* Next, go all the way to Ruan and talk to Portos outside the Aqua Rossa Bar at the south block.
** Talk to Harg at the end of the pier. He should be standing right next to the crates right by the fishing spot. He'll give you 3 [[Gasoline Tanks]]

* Lastly, go back to Elmo Village and go inside the shed

With that done, you can now go to Wolf Fort and talk to CWO Pace at the barracks.
He'll give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 13]]. This should be the last thing you get during your time in Zeiss.
Onwards to Grancel.

The mental picture of Estelle fishing at the Queen's place is too much.

The last part of chapter VIII happens at this region! In contrast to the other regions, the phones at Grancel Bracer
Guild are already fixed. So, there is no need to forfeit your ZFG to Elnan. Look at the sidequests available at the bulletin board.
For now, just do the two monster sidequests and move on to Rolent. BTW, If you have the [[Master Fisher Card]],
you can buy bait at the Fisherman Guild.

Don't forget to talk to Anton at the south exit of the department store
at the East Block. If you have been diligent by talking to him throughout the game, you should
get the achievement now.

Talk to Aina at the Rolent Bracer Guild. If you gave your ZFGs at Ruan, Zeiss, and Rolent, you'll finish the
first part of the mission! Aina will give you eight BP for handing out the ZFGs to the bracer guilds. Next,
you'll trigger another hidden sidequest. Head over to Malga Mine to begin the quest, [[Save the Miners]].
If you need the details, you can click the link this time. There aren't any bonus points, just a boss.

After you finished the hidden sidequest, head over to the Rolent Chapel to see the wedding. After the wedding
is over, don't forget to talk to Serra at Abend bar on the first floor. She's sitting right by the counter.
She'll give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 11]]. Also, talk to the Bar Owner and buy [[Heavenly Tempura]] from her.

As soon as you finished the hidden quest, be sure to go to Esmelas Tower and head over to the rooftop.
Defeat the Dimension Bug and you'll get [[Soul Orb]]. Also, because you were able to finish delivering
the ZFGs to Rolent, Ruan, and Bose guild, you will trigger a department sale at Bose (if you want all the items, be sure to check out all the stores because... well, I didn't keep track whoops). While it doesn't sound
any special, you get really cool food to buy like [[Mystery Paste Plus]], [[Worldly Stew]], and [[Rustic Bone]].
More importantly, talk to Minuet at Minuet Magazine Stand and she will give you the last volume of [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 14]]

If you don't have Ramblin' Gambler after reading all the books, you may have to do some actual gambling.
And I have no idea if Bounty Hunter triggers here, but you should absolutely have it.

===Liberl Kingdom: Last Minute Preparation===

At this point, you should have done all of the sidequests available and your overall BP should be ''372/380''.
Also, you should have all of the Gambler Jacks at this point. Once you feel
that you have done everything, it's time to go to Grancel. BTW, if you feel like you need to change your characters,
now it is a good time to do so. --u--''Once you are in Grancel Region near the city gate, all unresolved sidequests will
be locked.''--u--

On your way to Grancel, you should see a cutscene. Once you are in Grancel, head over to the Castle right away!

===Grancel Castle===
|* Misc. Treasures                                            |* Acheivements |
| [[Zeram Powder]]                                            |-2 ''League of Extraordinary Bracers'' |
| [[Zemurian Ore]] (Must have all 14 volumes of Gambler Jack) |

Once you are inside the city, you'll fight two Vanguards. Defeat them, and Elnan will show up! He'll give you
[[Zeram Powder]]. If you have all of the Gambler Jacks, head over to the top floor at Grancel Bracer Guild and
speak to Baral. He's standing at the southeast corner of the room right by the vase of pink flowers and a set of
books. Just like you did in Trails in the Sky: FC, you will have to relinquish all of the books, and he'll give you
a special item. It's not a weapon, but a stone called [[Zemurian Ore]]. Having the Zemurian Ore is your ticket
to the ultimate weapons. We'll discuss this more on the final chapter. For now, it's time to save the queen!

Head north towards the castle, and you'll fight three Pale Apaches. They should have the same
attack pattern as the previous battle in Chapter VI. Make sure that whoever holds the remaining ZFG should
be the healer! Also, watch out for Break Cannon because you are in a narrow space.
If you need a quick fix against the Pale Apaches, use Evil Eye or any other Crafts that
inflicts AT-Delay! It's the only way to prevent them from firing! Once the battle is over, head up
towards the Queen's Room. After a series of cutscene's Elnan will give you your results.

|* Results |
|''10000 Mira'' |
|''BP: 10''|

If you have been diligent on your quests, this should be the final results page. Your total should be ''382/380BP''.
Congrats, you've have earned all BP for Trails in the Sky: SC! If you are playing the PC version, you should
get the achievement ''League of Extraordinary Bracers''. After watching a series of cutscenes, chapter VIII has
come to a close.

* ''End of Chapter Totals''
** BP: 382 (Maximum)
** Chests: 385/517
** Recipes: [[Mystery Paste Plus]], [[Worldly Stew]], [[Rustic Bone]].

==Finale: Trails in the Sky==

''NOTE: If you have the Zemurian Ore, --u--DO NOT--u-- create the ultimate weapon just yet! you can get a second one
by getting Data Crystal Z at [[Residental Block Cradle]]. Once you have two Zemurian Ore, give it to Professor Russell at the Ariselle.

(Also, please note that if you did not get the Zemurian Ore the first time, you will not get the second Zemurian Ore. In other words,
it's basically all or nothing!)''

Be sure to buy [[Bitter Omelet]] from Arseille Food  Dispensary. And also [[Liberl News - Issue 11]].

On the final chapter, everyone can use arts without the ZFGs. So, you can take them off at this point.
After a climatic cutscene, head out of the Ariselle and go to Park Block - Calmare. From there, take the elevator
to the next floor. Next, examine the terminal at the center of the platform! You'll find an online shop with
your Orbal needs. Next, activate the Halo Rail and the Gate Lock! With the Halo Rail, you have access to
the "Light Rail" Station! (See what I did there :P) and unlocking the gate allows you traverse to the
Liber Ark Tunnels. However, the Halo Rail station serves as a shortcut for other parts of the Liber Ark.
At the moment, you cannot use the rail, so you need to traverse the tunnels. To get to the tunnel, go
down the elevator and enter the unlocked room on your right.

First, keep going straight until you hit the intersection at the second room. At the intersection, go southwest.
On the next corridor, head to the first door you see on your right. It should lead to the balcony at the end of the
path. At the balcony, there's a treasure containing the monster mob. Defeat it and you'll get [[Dominion]]. Go back
to the previous corridor and head to other door on your right; it'll lead to chest containing [[Silver Gem]].

On the next corridor, the path will split into two branches. Go right and you'll find ''All-Sepith x100'' at the end
of the path. Go back to the split path and head left. Before you take the door on your left, keep going straight and you'll
find [[Reviving Balm]] at the end of the path. Then take the door on your left and go inside the two small rooms at the
middle of the corridor. You'll find [[EP Charge II]] and [[Tearal Balm]]. Then head to the tail end of the corridor and
enter the door on your right.

On the third corridor, move northeast and you should find an [[Onyx Gem]] right next to the Dark Lamp. Continue to go
straight through a series of corridors. Stay on the right side of corridor and you'll find two small rooms. They contain
[[Zeram Powder]] and [[Curia Balm]]. Anyway, continue to move forward until you fight a mandatory enemy mob towards
the end of the tunnel.

^l69|Residential Block Cradle

As for which chest contains which item, Drache doesn't know because she did the map well after
opening the chests. This is also the last map she created and she was feeling lazy.

By the time you exit the tunnel, you should arrive at the Residental Block Cradle. First, examine the large house
west from the tunnel exit. Examine the computer, and it'll give you the recipe [[Resurrect Jelly]]. That's the last bit
of food to find, so be sure to cook it all for an achievement. You'll also find
[[EP Charge II]] and ''Water, Wind, and Space Sepith x100''

Next, head towards the house at the west end of the Residental area. You'll arrive inside a room with a large projector.
Ironically, the projector does not do anything. However, there's another terminal that will give you [[Data Crystal Z]].
Return to the house where you got Resurrection Jelly and select --u--''Data Crystal''--u--. With the Data Crystal Z
in your possession, you should get another [[Zemurian Ore]].

There are three treasures
to get at this residental home. You'll get [[Savory Pinion]], [[Juicy Bone]], [[Monster Fowl]], [[Monster Bird Egg]], and
[[Prickly Seed]] x10; [[Curative Horn]], [[Leathery Tail]], [[Lucky Fang]], [[Monster Carapace]], and [[Beast Flesh]] x10;
and [[Gummy Eyeball]], [[Fish Fillet]], [[Clear Gelatin]], and [[Fish Egg]] x10.

Next, go inside the house at the northeast
corner of the residental area. You'll find [[Tear All Balm]] inside. Don't forget to check the left side of the house outside.
You'll find a treasure chest containing ''Water, Wind, and Space Sepith x100'' behind the house. From the house at the
northeast corner, go down the stairs and then turn east to go up the staircase. There should be a treasure chest
on the edge of the platform containing [[Smelling Salts]]. Finally, head east towards the Eastern District of the Residental
area. There you'll fight a boss.

=--Boss: Leor Gun-EZ--=

Leor Gun-EZ will be accompanied with the red drones. Leor Gun-EZ uses Cyclone Laser to deal damage against your allies with
a defense debuff. It'll use Net Laser to reduce the overall movement of your ally. Finally, it'll use Missile Barrage
to deal heavy damage to one of your allies.

In this battle, you will need to rescue Josette, and she's on the verge of death. Because the enemy will take priority of
killing Josette, you will need to heal her at once. Also, you can use Joshua's Evil Eye to stall the Drone's turns. Once
Josette is in a safe position, just do your usual tactics to take down Leor Gun-EZ.
=-=

After the battle is over, Josette will join your party. If you want some interesting dialogue, bring Josette along for the ride.
Next, head over to the house at the east end of the residental cradle. You'll arrive at the Municipal Office. You'll find
two treasure chests containing [[Gold Gem]] and [[S-Tablet]]. There's a large terminal containing the Database. There's no point
of messing around with it, so go back to the Ariselle and examine the CAPEL at Prof. Russell Lab. Fortunately, there's a shortcut. Go
southwest towards the elevator. Once you are top of the cradle, activate the Halo Rail. Unfortunately, you need a Gospel
to unlock the gate to Liber Ark Tunnel - 2. So, take the rail and go to the Ariselle. If you want to read more about the ultimate weapon
click on this link: [[Ultimate Weapon Creation Guide]].


Based on the Data Crystal #0, the name is ''Celeste D. Auslese''. Bring Kloe along and go back to Muncipal Office. At the terminal
choose ''Kloe'', ''Celeste'', ''D.'' ''Auslese''. The terminal will give you [[Original Gospel]]. Now, go back to the elevator and
examine the large terminal at the center. Go to your item list and select Original Gospel. This will unlock the gate to Liber Ark Tunnel 2.
Go to the elevator platform, and head to the door below.

===Liber Ark Tunnels - 2===

^l64| Tunnels 2

First, head down the stairs, and keep going straight. At the first T-intersection, turn left and you'll find a monster treasure
chest at the very end of the path. Defeat them and you'll get [[Hermes Gear]]. Then, go back to the T-intersection and move
northeast. Continue to go straight until you see a large room with layered floors. Stay on the top layer and walk on the left
perimeter of the room. There should be a door at the northeast end of the room. At the small room, there should be three treasures:
''Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water Sepith x100'', [[Celestial Balm]], and [[Briarios]]. Once you have the treasures, backtrack to
the vast room and descend through the staircase to the bottom floor. Go straight until you find another vast room with multiple
layered floors. This next segment, I will guide you through the labyrinth while getting all of the treasure.

Starting from the bottom floor, go up the stairs twice then make a right. Go up the stairs the third time and go north. You'll find
a [[Wind Gem]]. Then go south and walk along the perimeter. Before you take the stairs, go forward and you'll find another [[Celestial Balm]].
Then go to the stairs, and go south at the top layer. You'll find another small room at the end of the path. You'll find a treasure
chest containing [[Lion King's Sword]] (Since when Simba wields a sword? =/). Anyway, go back to the intersection where you took
the stairs and go north. You should see a door at the northeast side of the room. However, we are going at the tail end of the path.
You should find a small room containing [[Persetear]].

Now head to the door at the northeast side of the room. You'll find another monster mob on your way to the exit. Defeat them and you'll
exit the tunnels.

| 3 | ''Earth, Water, Fire, Wind Sepith x100'' |

^l70|Industrial Block

At the large intersection, go west and you'll find [[Omega Craft]] at the end of the path behind the crates. Next,
as you walk along the narrow hall, there should be a small path on the right side. It should lead to a large "Fan".
At the center, you'll find [[Mirage Gem]]. Continue to move north. Before you enter the second area of the industrial block,
head east past the narrow bridge. Head to the center of the "fan" and move northeast. You should find ''Earth, Water, Fire, and Wind Sepith x100''.

On the second area, on the first intersection go west. From there, go south on the second intersection. You'll find an
elevator which will lead you to the Halo Rail. Go to the terminal and unlock the rail. Unfortunately, you cannot unlock the door
to Liber Ark Tunnels - 3 because you need a passcode. So, head back to the elevator and go east. On area 3, continue to go east.
Joshua will tell you that once you enter the ship, there's no turning back. Once you say yes, it's time to board the ship. First,
deal with the enemy mob before entering the Glorious.

^l62| Glorious, Stern 2F

If you remember from chapter VI, there was the center path on each floor that was full of electrical blockade. This time, we are exploring
the center path. Also, if you plan to retrieve any treasures you missed on chapter VI, this is your opportunity to get them again.
In this section, we are going to emphasize on the center path.

On the first intersection near the entrance, go southeast. On the first corridor past the first electrical barrier and Leor-Gun EZ,
there should be a room on the north side. You'll find six treasures: [[Tear All Balm]] x2, [[EP Charge II,]], [[Tearal Balm]], [[Revolter]]
and a monster chest. Defeat them, and you'll get [[Grail Locket]]. Go to the room next door and you'll find six more treasures:
[[EP Charge II]], ''All-Sepith x100'', [[Celestial Balm]], [[Tear Balm]], [[Smelling Salts]], and [[Seven Star Sword]]. Next, go
to the third door on the right. It should lead to the Brig. After Joshua tells you that you need a key card at the 2nd floor
at the forecastle, be sure to grab the two treasures at the tail end of the corridor. Unfortunately, they are well guarded by the
barrier. So, you need to go to the 2nd floor of the forecastle.

So, go all the way back at the starting point and go northwest at the intersection. This will lead to the Stern: First Floor.
n the first corridor past the first electrical barrier and Leor-Gun EZ, there should be a room on the north side. You'll find
six more treasures layed out for you. You'll find [[Celestial Balm]], ''All-Sepith x100'', [[Tearal Balm]] x2, [[EP Charge II]],
and [[Dark Messiah]]. Next, there's a door on the southside of the room. They contain three treasures: [[S-Tablet]], [[EP Charge II]],
and [[Zeram Powder]]. Next, there should be a room on the north side before the electrical barrier. You should find three more
treasures: [[Celestial Balm]], [[Tearal Balm]], and [[Aurelia Dress]]. Next, keep going forward. When you arrive outside, you'll fight
three Pale Apaches. It's the same tactics as last time.

Anyway, when you arrive at Forecastle 1, head to the two room in-between the two electrical barriers. In the south room, you'll find
[[Tear All Balm]], [[Teara Balm]], and [[Jagd Panzer]]. In the north room, you'll find [[Reviving Balm]], [[Tearal Balm]], and
[[Rosenkrantz]]. From there, take the elevator to Forecastle 2. When you arrive on the second floor, head on the left side and
go to the fourth room from the top. You'll find [[Security Card]]. Once you have the Security Card, go back down to the brig.
On your way, you'll find another boss.

=--Boss: Riot Arm and New Gilbert--=
Riot Arm uses Riot Wave and Charge to deal heavy damage within the line. Also, Riot Arm's normal attack and Riot Press deals heavy damage.
New Gilbert on the other hand employs the same tactics used against you in Chapter VI and VIII. First off, attack Gilbert before taking
on Riot Arm. Gibert should die off very quickly. Once you get to Riot Arm, be sure to use strong attacks used against a single opponent.
=-=

Note: Drache needs to actually play the game again to properly integrate this, but a message
from CarlosPSP2 states that you should try to go to the Factoria Terminal, use the orbal thing,
THEN go back to Kyle. Hopefully this eliminates any confusion.

Before you go to free the prisoners, make sure you use the security card and unlock gate
--u--''2 and 4''--u--. If you freed the prisoners before you get the treasures, you will not come back after this event.
Anyway, you'll find ''All-Sepith x300'' and [[Jagd Guarders]]. Then unlock the prisoners by choosing ''1''. Josette will gain her
S-Craft, the Bobcat! Speaking of Bobcat, go inside the Bobcat and talk to Kyle. He'll mention about the word --u--''Orpheus''--u--, which
is the password for the terminal at the Industrial Block. Go to the terminal at the industrial block area and use your Original Gospel.
Choose --u--''Orpheus''--u--. The gate to the third tunnel awaits you.

Go down stairs and go straight until you hit the intersection at the third room. Go west and you'll find ''All-Sepith x100''. Then go east
and you'll find [[Curia Balm]]. After you make a sharp left turn on the fourth room, go all the way at the end of the path in corridor 5.
You'll find [[EP Charge II]]. Continue to go straight past the large room. On corridor 8, there's two small doors on the north side of the
corridor. On the door from the right side of the corridor, you'll find three treasures: [[EP Charge III]], [[Celestial Balm]], and a monster
mob. Defeat them and you'll get [[Speigel Shoes]]. On the door from the left side of the corridor, you'll find three more treasures:
[[Curia Balm]], ''All-Sepith x100'', and [[Wood Gem]]. Continue to go straight until you found a room with two doors. When you arrive to that
room, head left and you'll arrive on the balcony floor. At the end of the path you'll find seven treasures lined up together. They are
[[Water Gem]], [[S-Tablet]], [[Curia Balm]], [[Emergency Puppet]], [[EP Charge II]], [[Tear All Balm]], and a monster chest. Defeat it, and
you'll get [[Parthenon Gear]]. Once you have all of the treasures, head back to the other room and go to the door on your right. From
there, go straight until you hit the exit. Also, you'll find an enemy mob before you leave the tunnel.

As you approach to the entrance, you'll fight another Riot Arm with Solid Seeker. It's the same battle as the one with Gilbert back at
the Glorius except when you kill Solid Seeker, it'll use Death Throes to increase STR and DEF. Once you defeat the monster mob,
turn back. You would want to head to the elevator and activate the Halo Rail back to the Ariselle. Once you are in the Ariselle,
talk to Julia at the bridge. She and Mueller will join your party. Now, let's go to the final dungeon!!!!

===Axis Pillar===
''NOTE: It's ideal to bring certain characters along against a particular boss. Bring the right character along and they will
recieve a major dialogue and character revalation! The only thing that you have to deal with is going to the Ariselle and
back. It's entirely up to you if want to see the character dialogue.''

^l66| Axix Pillar 1F - 3F


;|* Monsters Central Tower? |
;| [[Riot Claw]] |
;| [[Solid Seeker]] |

On the first floor, you'll find six treasures near the inactive teleport gate. You'll find: [[Reviving Balm]], [[Zeram Capsule]], [[Emergency Puppet]],
[[Tear All Balm]] x2, and [[Long Barrel III]] Keep going straight until you see the T-intersection. When you arrive there, go south
and you'll find a treasure chest at the end of the path. You'll find a monster mob inside the chest. Defeat it, and you'll get [[Brave Staff]].
Return back to the t-intersection and move forward. You'll find an elevator to the second floor.

====Axis Pillar: Second Floor====

On the second floor, go straight until you see the platform with the inactive teleport gate in the center. Go northeast and you'll engage
against your first boss. So, prepare yourself before you proceed forward.

=--Boss: Bleublanc (Enforcer X) and Balancing Clown--=

Balancing Clown will use Marionette to deal light damage and saps away 30CP and inflicts
stun or seal It also use Pitfall to inflict AT-Delay to one of your allies. Next, Bleublanc
use Shadow Cast to create clones of himself. Bleublanc will use Wild Card to inflict
a random status effect and use Akashic Rain to deal wide area of effect damage on your allies.
Once Bleublanc's HP is close to 50%, it'll unleash its S-Craft, Death Magic. Lastly,
Bleublance summons reinforcements anytime one of the Balancing Clown dies. Overall,
he does not change up his attack pattern from the previous bout.

You may have to concentrate your attack towards Bleublanc because he'll summon another
balancing clown at any moment. Use Joshua's Abyss Fall or Death Scream to wipe away all
of Bleublanc's clones. Other than that, just use S-Craft and Chain Craft to deal damage.
=-=

After the battle is over, examine the small terminal box and you'll unlock the gate
to the next corridor. Keep going straight until you found the large platform with Fortune Coin
and Estrian Quartre on it. You'll find eight treasures: [[Celestial Balm]], [[S-Tablet]], ''All-Sepith x100'',
[[Jormungandr]], [[EP Charge III]], [[Curia Balm]], [[Tear All Balm]], and [[Tiger Heart]]! After getting
a horde of treasures, keep going straight until you found the elevator to the third floor.

====Axis Pillar: Third Floor====

On the third floor, keep going straight until you hit the third room. There, you'll find four treasures
throughout the corridor. They are [[Tearal Balm]], [[Celestial Balm]], [[Curia Balm]] and [[S-Tablet]].
Keep going straight until you are in the room with a locked door and an inactive teleport gate. You know
what's going to happen next. You'll fight the next boss. So, prepare yourself before entering the room
on your left.

=--Boss: Walter (Enforcer VIII) and Shadow Cougar x2--=
At the start of the battle, Finally, Walter will unleash his
S-Craft, Ultimate Blow which deals devastating damage plus inflicts faint to
anyone within a medium circle. He gains a new move called Zero Impact which deals
devastating damage to one of your allies plus it deals a strength debuff.
Walter will use Sonic Shot to deal heavy damage to anyone surrounding him. Next, Walter
will use Infinity Combo and Sonic Shot to deal heavy damage.

Shadow Cougar will use Wind Blade as it moves around dealing damage to anyone
within the trajectory. Next, it'll use Cleave Shot to deal damage plus inflicting
faint. It'll also use Seal Blade or Death Blade to inflict seal or instant death
to any of your allies.

Other than Shadow Cougars and Walter gaining a single move, the tone of the battle remains
the same. So, do the same tactics you used last time against Walter.
=-=

After the battle is over, head to the terminal box and examine it. You'll unlock the locked
door and activate the teleport gate. Continue to move forward until you hit the fourth floor.

====Axis Pillar: Fourth Floor====

|*+4   4F                                             |* Monsters          |

| 25 | [[S-Tablet]]        | 32 | [[EP Charge III]]   |
| 26 | ''All Sepith x100'' | 33 | [[Gaia Suit]]       |

^l67| Axix Pillar 4F

Go straight until you are in the second room. At the second room, turn right at the T-intersection.
You'll find a monster chest. Defeat it, and you'll find [[Prometheus]]. Keep going straight until
you find a large platform with Artiball on it! You'll find six treasures: [[Curia Balm]],
[[S-Tablet]], [[Shine Sphere]], [[Lily Necklace]], [[EP Charge II]], and ''All-Sepith x100''.
Go straight until you see the inactive teleport gate. Prepare yourself and move forward.
You'll fight the next boss.

=--Boss: Luciola (Enforcer VII)--=
Luciola will start the battle using a different S-Craft, Hellfire which deals devastating
fire damage against your allies. Like, Bleublanc, she'll use Shadow Replication.
However, in contrast to Bleublanc's version, Luciola's Shadow replication will switch
her clones with your allies. You need to choose the correct target, all of her duplicates
will disappear. However, do not use all range attack to destroy her duplicates because
she'll switch with two of your allies. Also, Luciola unleashes Tempest Dance to deal
heavy damage to everyone. Also, she uses Firestorm to deal fire elemental damage at long
distance. Each of her long distance attacks pushes you back a bit.

Then you have annoying Jubukko, Zaqqum, and the Alrunes to deal with. Because Luciola
is constantly using Shadow Replication throughout the battle, you really need to think
when to use your all range arts or S-Crafts. Other than that, the strategy to use
against Luciola remains the same. Just kill everyone on the battlefield and take out
Jubukko last with your arts.
=-=

After the battle is over, head to the terminal box and examine it. As always, the door
will unlock and the teleport gate will be activated. Continue to move forward. You'll
find six more treasures along the way. They are [[Reviving Balm]], [[EP Charge II]],
[[EP Charge III]] x2, [[Celestial Balm]], and [[Curia Balm]]. Keep going straight
until you see another treasure chest at the middle of the road. You'll find a monster
chest. Defeat it and you'll get [[Gaia Suit]]. Keep going straight until you see the
elevator.

====Axis Pillar: Fifth Floor====

|*+2  5F                          |*+2   6F                    |

|   35 |   [[Tear All Balm]]      | 40 | ''All-Sepith x100''   |

                                  | 43 | [[Aura Fencer]]       |
								  | 44 | [[Curia Balm]]        |
								  | 45 | [[Armored Sieglinde]] |


^l68| Axix Pillar 5F - 6F

On the fifth floor keep going straight until you see the four treasures on the second
corridor. You'll find [[S-Tablet]], [[Tear All Balm]], [[Tearal Balm]], and [[Armored Barbarossa]]
Keep going straight until you see the inactive teleport gate. You have another boss waiting for
you. Since you know who you are going to fight next, I suggest you have everyone wearing anti-deathblow
accessories because you are going to need it.

=--Boss: Renne (Enforcer XV) and Pater-Mater--=
Contrary to the first bout, Renne will not use her S-Craft on the first turn. However, Pater-Mater
will accompany her and it'll go all out. It'll use Gigant Press to deal devastating damage to a single
ally and it'll use its S-Craft Double Buster Cannon to deal devastating damage within the trajectory.
Also, anytime Renne is knocked out, Pater Mater will use Revival Beam to revive her HP by 10000.
Renne on the other hand employs the same tactics as last time, however all of her attacks have a slight
chance to inflict instant death. Renne will use Blood Circle which is basically True Hurricane with
substantial knock back. Finally she'll use Calamity throw to deal moderate damage at long range.

This time, you can start the battle without any sudden surprises on the first turn. Anyway, you have
to do what you can to deal damage against Pater-Mater because he's the biggest threat for the entire
bout. Knowing that Pater-Mater will revive her at any moment, you need to prioritize your physical
offense on Pater Mater. Other than that, you are going have to whittle away Pater-Mater's health while
dealing Renne's aggressive offense.
=-=

After the battle is over, examine the terminal box and proceed to the next floor.

====Axis Pillar: Sixth Floor====

|* Achievements |
| ''Baby, Come Back'' (Assuming nothing is bugged) |

On the sixth floor, keep going straight until you see the large platform with D-G Diver on it.
There are six treasures for you to take. They are [[EP Charge III]], [[Tear All Balm]], [[Curia Balm]],
[[Insulating Tape]], ''All-Sepith x100'', and a monster chest. Defeat the monster mob and you'll get [[Aura Fencer]].
Keep going straight until you find the treasure chest at the middle of the road; you'll find [[Armored Sieglinde]].
Now, go forward until you see the recovery point. At this point, you need to prepare yourself because the
next set of battles will be very tough. --u--''CHOOSE YOUR PARTY MEMBERS WISELY BECAUSE THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME FOR YOU TO
SWITCH PARTY MEMBERS''--u-- Anyway, I suggest that you have someone to wear accessories that prevents faint, stun and confuse.
Honestly, Once you are on the elevator platform, get ready for a series of battles.

=--Boss: Loewe the Bladelord (Enforcer II) and Riot Saber x2--=

Loewe will start the battle with his S-Craft, Demon Blade which deals devastating damage to everyone. Next, he'll use
body split to make clones of himself. He'll cast Silver Thorn to deal heavy mirage attack to allies within range as
well as inflicting confuse. He'll sometimes use earth guard to grant himself complete damage immunity. Also, he'll
deal damage your allies from a distance using Riot Storm. Sometimes Loewe will use another S-Craft,
Dead Emperor Sword which deals devastating damage to all of your allies. He uses Dead Emperor Sword at any moment!

Riot Saber is another enemy to deal with. It'll use Plasma Ball to deal damage from a distance plus inflicting seal.
Also, it has Riot Star to deal heavy damage to anyone within a large area. Next, it'll use Riot Press to deal heavy
damage.

This is definitely the toughest battle in the game! All of Loewe's attacks deal devastating damage. It's so severe
that the Riot Sabers can finish you off within a few turns. This battle is all about damage immunity! If you have
Kevin with you, you need to cast Grail Sphere pronto! Even after the initial onslaught, you need to keep casting
Earth Wall because you don't know if Loewe will use Dead Emperor Sword. If you have to use Zeram Powder or
Capsule, use it on Kevin as he will cast Grail Sphere instantanously.

Offensively, you may want to let your opponents come to you. Loewe uses Body Split to add two more clones of himself
and the Riot Sabers are often aggressive by using Riot Star. Ideally, you would want Zane to use Thunder God Kick
to deal multiple hits with heavy damage. If you don't want to use Zane in battle, then use Chain Crafts as your alternative.
However, if someone is a dedicated Earth Wall caster, then leave that person out for the Chain Craft attack. Throughout
the battle, you need to keep your immune barriers up at all times due to Loewe's unpredictable attacks.
If you win against Loewe, you'll get [[Gladiator Belt]] and [[Zeram Capsule]]. However, if it's too much, you can make the
battle easier by pressing continue on the Game Over screen.
=-=

=--Boss: T.M. Dragion--=

Anytime someone is casting arts, T.M. Dragion will use AA Canceller! It'll use Hyper Laser to deal heavy damage within
the line. Sometimes, it'll use Hyper Knuckle to deal heavy damage against a single ally. This battle is really easy
compared to Loewe. Make sure that someone casts Clock Down on T.M. Dragion. Next, use Forte or any Strength buff
to your physical attackers. From there, use regular attacks to deal damage against the boss! This is a good opportunity
to build up CP for the next battle!
=-=

===Core Sector - Themelios===

Once you arrived and used the recovery point, keep going straight! This will be the only time to set your equipment before
taking on the final boss!

=--Final Boss: Weissmann the Anguis--=

First off, Weissmann uses Dark Matter EX to pull in your allies while dealing moderate damage plus it reduces your field movement.
Weissmann uses Dimension Exile to take out one of your allies. Next, Weissmann uses Genesic Barrier which grants full
protection against Arts to all of his allies. Next, Weissmann uses True Evil Eye to deal light damage plus inflicting
confuse and AT-Delay! Finally, he uses his S-Craft, Another Dimension to deal heavy damage on everyone! Don't forget
that Weissman is accompanied with four Guard Shells to annoy the crap out of you!

You may want to beat his first form really fast because the moment Weissman casts Genesic Barrier, you are going to have
a harder time taking down your opponents. So, what you want to do is to buff everyone's strength and defense and use
All-range attacks like Death Scream, Phantom Raid, Dragon Dive and Etc. After that, concentrate your attacks on Weissman
afterwards. Don't worry if Weissman uses Dimensional Exile on you because your character comes back roughly around 8th-12th
turn. This is only the first round, so don't get all complacent just yet!
=-=

=--Final Boss: Angel Weissman--=

Weissman will use Calamatous Star Shabatt to deal heavy damage on everyone and pushes them to the edge of the battlefield. Greed Looper will
sap away 30 CP each time it attacks your allies. Next, it uses Power Light Enil to heal(wtf?) your ally plus inflicts confuse.
Then it uses Goddess Light Inanna to deal heavy damage within a large area plus debuff their defense. Occassionally,
it'll revive one of the Greed Looper. Once Angel Weissmann's HP is less than 33%, it's going to start casting Arc Prominence!
Lastly, Angel Weissman will be accompanied with four Greed Loopers! These guys are really annoying because they take out a lot
of your CP with each successive attacks.

First and foremost, take the Greed Looper out first using your S-Craft. I suggest that you build up your CP meter using regular
attacks because Angel Weissman likes to reduce its own defenses giving you a lot of opportunity to deal a lot of damage. Just
keep whittling away his HP with regular attacks. You want to save your energy for the final phase!
%
On the second form, this is where everything gets really tricky! First off, his HP is already hitting the cap at 99,999HP.
It'll be accompanied with four Alpha-Omegas. The Alpha-Omega has the ability to take away the tile of the battlefield. If
anyone falls under the hole, your character is gone for the rest of the battle. Back to Angel Weissman, he has a ton of
arsenals to use. He will use Serpent Strike Agulis to deal heavy damage to one of your allies any where on the battlefield
plus it interupts your casting time. Occassionally, it uses Calamatous Star Shabatt to deal heavy damage on everyone and
pushes them to the edge of the battlefield. Once its HP is less than 50%, it's going to glow green and charges up for
an attack. It uses Shining Burst Adante to deal devastating damage on everyone. Also, Angel Weissmann will try to sap
away all of its CP on one of its turns as well. Next, it'll lower down its overall defense on one turn and then it
gets a major strength and speed buff the following turn! Finally, towards the last 10% of its health, it's going to cast
Ruined World Noaba where it completely vanishes your ally within the small circle! If your allies got hit by Ruined World
Noaba, consider your ally permanently dead!

During the first phase, Angel Weissman will strengthen its overall defenses. So, look up on the element chart while choosing
Weissman as your target. You should see which element he's weak against. Whatever that element is, spam it until he puts
his arts resistance back to normal. Once Angel Weissmann's elemental resistance has normalized, you can now use your physical
attacks. So use S-Craft and Chain Crafts to deal significant damage! There will be moments where Angel Weissmann will lower
down its overall defenses. This is a good time to use S-Craft against it! As you take away his health slowly, he will do a lot
of charged attacks. Unfortunately, all of his charged attacks cannot be stopped, so you may want to use Earth Wall or Guard to
prevent major damage against your allies. Finally, when it start casting Ruined World Noaba and there's a small circle on
one of your allies, get out of the small circle immediately! Continue to deal damage until he falls!
=-=

After the battle is over, use the emergency tunnels by going west! From there, keep going straight forward. Enjoy your cutscenes
and your ending! You deserved it after years of waiting!

==Chapter Sidequests==

===Chapter 1===

====Come, Ingredient Hunters====

* [[City of Ruan]]
** Mira: 1500 (+1000)
** BP: 2 (+1)
** Timeframe: Long
** Expires: -

Talk to Orvid on the second floor of the Magnolia Inn. He'll give you a list of ingredients, but he has them all. Your main objective is to find
ingredients that are NOT part of the list! You only need to find three missing ingredients to satisfy the quest. However, we are going an extra mile and find all six
missing ingredients. After all, we have extra BP at stake.

I hope you have the [[Luck]] Quartz. This will be very useful considering that the following ingredients are monster drops. Please note that --u--''whoever is
holding the luck quartz, make sure that person gets the final blow against a certain monster. This will increase the chances of finding the items you need''--u--
Anyway, here's a table for the missing ingredients.

|* Ingredient        |* Monster and Location |
| [[Juicy Bone]]     | Seahorse Demon in Sapphirl Tower |
| [[Lucky Fang]]     | Guard Boar in Vista Forest Road or Aurian Causeway / Wrap Spider in Underground Ruins |
| [[Tender Poultry]] | Roadrunner in Vista Forest Road or Aurian Causeway / Ballbat in Underground Ruins |
| [[Fish Egg]]       | Crocodark in Gull Seaside Way |
| [[Bird Egg]]       | Roadrunner in Vista Forest Road or Aurian Causeway / Ballbat in Underground Ruins |
| [[Curative Horn]]  | Helmet Crab in Sapphirl Tower |

Remember, he only needs one sample of each of the missing ingredients. Also, you have until the end of chapter to finish this quest. If you have all six missing
ingredients, you get twenty [[Savory Pinion]].
%
====Sapphirl Tower Photo====

*[[City of Ruan]]
**Mira: 2000 (+1000)
**BP: 1 (+2)
**Timeframe: Medium
**Expires: After the end of Chapter I

Talk of Santos at the first floor of Hotel Blanche on the first room from the left side of the entrance. Go to the Sapphirl Tower and take the picture at the pedestal.
I suggest that you put off this sidequest until you have Dorothy in your party. The reason why this is important because the quality of the photograph
gives you bonus BP. Having Dorothy do the photograph will give you the most optimal results. The only drawback is to babysit Dorothy for the entire dungeon.

Anyway, when you get to the top floor, stand on this spot as shown on this image. Once Estelle is about to take a picture, she'll ask Dorothy to take
the picture! --u--''LET DOROTHY TAKE THE PHOTO''--u-- After that, show it to Santos in Hotel Blanche. If you did it correctly, the photograph should look
colorful and vivid. Santos will give you [[Moonglasses]] as your reward. Report your results to Jean.

^l2|A: Photo spot!

====Vista Forest Road Monster====

*[[City of Ruan]]
**Mira: 1500
**BP: 2
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

The location of the boss is in the 2nd area of Vista Forest Rd. The boss is rght at the southern perimeter of the O-shaped path.

=-----=
''Boss: Mercury Viper x2''

It only does two things: move around at random positions and spew venom at a distance. Obviously, whoever gets hit by the venom will be poisoned.
If you have been vigilant with your bracer ranking, you should have items with poison resistance such as Silver Chain or Earring. Just kill it
with your normal attacks. If you have Kevin with you, use him as your primary healer. It's a really easy battle.
=-=
%
====Gull Seaside Way Monster====

*[[City of Ruan]]
**Mira: 2500
**BP: 3
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

When you arrive Gull Seaside Way from Ruan, there's a sandy landmass at the center of the road. There should be a monster guarding the narrow pathway.

=-----=
''Boss: Cobalt Saber x3''

These monsters have high physical defense. Not only they hit very hard, but they can inflict poison as well. If one of the Cobalt Sabers fall, they will use
Death Throes as their last resort. This will give the remaining allies a significant defense and agility buff. I suggest that you wait until you get Kevin
or another plot related character to beat this battle. If you are willing to beat them with only two people, be sure to use arts with a wide area of effect.
%

====Lighthouse Test Run====

--u--''HIDDEN SIDEQUEST''--u--

*[[Mercia Orphanage and Manoria Village]]
**Mira: 1000 (+500)
**BP: 2 (+1)
**Timeframe: Short
**Expires: After the end of chapter I

As soon you can leave Ruan, immediately go to Varenne Lighthouse! Head to the top floor of the lighthouse and talk to Vogt.
He'll give you a bonus BP question. Choose --u--''is there something you need done?''--u-- Once you are ready, do the following.

=-----=
*Set stabilizer to ''low''
*Set orbal amplitude to ''low''
*''Turn on'' activation switch.
*Switch orbal amplitude to ''mid''
*Set stabilizer to ''mid''.
*Set orbal amplitude to ''High''
*Set stabilizer  to ''High''

=-=

If you did it correctly, you'll trigger a cutscene. Vogt will reward you with five [[Polychaete]] and [[Shrimplet]] as your reward.
Before you finish the sidequest, there's one more bonus BP question. Choose --u--''Anything else we can do for you?''--u-- After that,
report it to Jean.

quickly by using physical attacks. Any moves with AT delay will help you tremendously. Lastly, be sure to use Olivier's happy trigger to heal

should have chain 2 because the enemies like to crowd in a lot. Use wide area of effect arts like Spiral Flare or Aero Storm and use S-Craft when necessary. This battle is tough, so
keep at it.

''Boss: Flame Velgr x4''

You may have fought it at Carnelia Tower earlier in chapter 2. It has the same moveset such as Feather
Shower which hits a large area of effect and Rolling Dive as its special attack. What makes it menacing
is that it's accompanied by Hell Mars which unleashes Mars Star as its special attack. The most threatening
part of this battle is overwhelming you in sheer numbers. So, you need to take out Flame Velgrs by

|* Ingredient            |*Quantity |* Location                      |
| [[Monster Carapace]]   |  ''5''   | Coral Shell in Esmelas Tower   |
| [[Savory Pinon]]       |  ''5''   | Red Insectos in Malga Trail    |
| [[Prickly Seed]]       |  ''5''   | Mantrap in Milch Main Road     |
| [[Pearlglass]]         |  ''1''   | Fishing spot in Elize Highway, Mistwald, or Milch Main Road |

Assuming that you were diligent from doing the other sidequests in the previous chapters you should have adequate amount of
Monster Carapace, Savory Pinion, and Prickly Seed in your possession. Your main concern is the Pearlglass. It's a large fish
located in one of the three fishing spots. Generally, you have the best chance of catching Pearlglass by using the [[Bamboo Fishing Rod]]
and river snail as your bait. If you do not have it, you may want to use your default rod and use earthworm.
Your chances are slim, but you can tell you caught a big fish if the wait time is much longer than usual. Once you have
all of the ingredients, present it to Anton. After a long cutscene, report to Aina even though she witnessed Anton's
antics. :P

''HIDDEN SIDEQUEST''

To trigger this sidequest, you will need to relinquish one of your Zero Field Generator to
Jean. He'll inform you to check out the neighboring areas around Ruan. What he means is that
check out Jenis Royal Academy! On your way to Jenis Academy, you'll engage battle against
two Blade Cougars! Don't forget to protect Mickey while you are fighting the Blade Cougars.

Next, Joshua will have infiltrate the school on his own. So, examine all of the windows
throughout the the perimeter of the school. Be sure to get a conversation from Hans and Jill
before you go. Next, take the back gate towards the Old School House and you'll return
with your allies. Also, this is the only time Anelace and Kurt will join the battle as
guest party members! Your next mission is to rescue all the hostages. These are the places
where you will find the hostages.

|*-2 Clubhouse      | Girl's Locker Room         | Deborah, Ms. Wiola, and Ms. Millia  (You'll get Mighty Essence along the way) |
                    | Boy's Locker Room          | Mr. Effort and Mr. Ratio |
|*-4 Schoolhouse    | Dean's Office              | Dean Collins and Fauna |
                    | Humanities Classroom       | Jill, Hans, Kaden, Alice, and Purity |

After rescuing everyone on the list above, it's time to rescue Richelle. She's located at the
old schoolhouse at the back of the academy. You'll engage battle against Gilbert. Honestly, this battle
is such a joke. While Gilbert employs the same tactic against you back in Chapter VI, he does
everything at a comical matter. So, just do your usual tactics and you are done with it. After the
battle is over, Kurt and Anelace :( will leave your party. Report your mission to Jean after
retaking the Jenis Academy. Don't forget to get the book, [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 12]] at the Humanities
Classroom before you go.

====Tratt Plains Monster: Redux====
*[[Liberl: Zeiss Region]]
**Mira: 6500
**BP: 5
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: After initiating the main sidequest "Danger in the Capital"

The location of this boss is not in the middle of nowhere in contrast to the other two monster quests
earlier in Chapter II. Anyway, the location of the boss is on side of the main road towards Wolf Fort. It's
a big worm, so you can't miss it!

=-----=
''Boss: Abyss Worms x8''

If you recall from chapter II, the Abyss Worm will use Lightning Fall to deal moderate damage from a distance.
However, once its HP is less than 100%, it's going to spam Earth Shaker like no tomorrow. It sucks dealing
with four Abyss Worms. Now, let's see if you can deal with eight of them! This can be a very difficult battle
if you are not careful. However, the Abyss Worm will --u--''NOT USE EARTH SHAKER IF ITS AT FULL HEALTH!''--u--
Having said that, I'm sure that your party members can take on a few lightning bolts. Anyway, the key of beating this battle is to
manipulate the turn order against your opponent. Also, observe how the Abyss Worm's movement throughout the
battlefield. If a bunch of them begin to crowd around each other, this could be an golden opportunity to deal
substantial damage. But, that depends on your party set up!

At the start of the battle, make sure that someone is casting Clock UP EX to increase your ally's agility by
50%. Next, cast Clock Down to drastically reduce their agility! Then cast Earth Guard to ensure that your allies
will be okay against their attack. From there, you can go offensive against the worms. You can do this one at a
time, but you run at a risk of exhausting your resources in the process. If you are going to deal with them one
at a time, make sure your physical characters will deal damage while Joshua casts Evil Eye to discourage other
Abyss Worms to attack you.

Personally, I prefer to attack them in clusters! Because Zane is my main attacker, he was responsible of dealing
most of the damage against the worms. First, I use True Distend to raise his STR and DEF by 60%. I also have Estelle
casting Clock UP EX on Zane while someone else can cast Clock Down on the worms the following turn. Make sure that
Joshua is delaying his opponent's turn by using Evil Eye. He should not be doing anything else during this phase.
If you know that the Abyss Worms are crowding around each other, it's time to use Thunder God Kick. If you managed
to get up to five worms inside the small circle, execute it right away. If you are playing the PC version, the damage
is devastating plus you get extra hits depending how many worms that was inside the circle. Using Thunder God Kick
should be the main offense against the worms. However, if you are playing the PSP version, the damage should be significant
as well. You need another character to facilitate the damage.

Agate should deal damage as well by using Wild Rage 2 and Final Break 2 attack as well. DO NOT USE DRAGON DIVE unless
you are confident enough to take on all eight worms at once. Tita should act as support and use arts and a bit of
S-Craft as well. If you are using Scherazard, you can use her Wind arts and Heaven's Whip to prioritize your allies
turns. Finally, use Chain Crafts to deal damage, but do not choose Joshua as your co-attacker. He needs to lock down
on the worms using Evil Eye. Whatever set up you have, make sure that the Abyss Worm's speed is reduced while Joshua
is casting Evil Eye on each turn. Once you have the worms under control, you should get [[Poison 2]] as one of the
dropped items.

The way Drache did it was to nuke the crap out of them, though this isn't the "proper" way. Get as high ATS
as possible and start with 200 CP. Zero attacking during Clock Up setup, but after that hit everything on
the field as hard as you can.

path before the entrance to the town! Be sure to equip anti-deathblow accessories
before taking on this boss!

=-----=
''Boss: Blade Cougar x5''

Chances are, you probably encountered these guys back at Jenis Academy. These guys use Seal Blade
to inflict seal against your allies. Also, it uses Wind Blade to deal moderate damage while
traversing to the other end of the field. Finally, it uses Death Blade to deal Deathblow to
one of your allies. This should be a easy battle considering you have experience fighting the
Cougars. By defeating the boss, it'll drop [[Blind 2]].

After you gave the ZFG to Kilika, she'll tell you about the incident at Elmo Village. Bring Tita
along and head over to Elmo Village. Go to the Maple Leaf Inn and talk to Mao. You need to talk to
her twice and choose offer her help anyway. Mao will give you the Pump Shed Key. The Pump Shed
is located at the outskirts of town near the entrance to the Hot Springs Cave. Tita will inform
you that you will have to make a combustion engine. In other words, you need to do a lot of
walking around. So, you will have to do the following. BTW, I suggest you equip Cloak and Night Goggles
because you will do a lot of walking.

=-----=
*Head back to Zeiss and go to the Landing Port. Talk to Gustav, who is wearing the orange jumpsuit with blue hair.

*Go to Leiston Fortress and talk to Private Samuel about the combustion engine.
**''UPDATE:'' --u--You don't have to walk to Leiston Fortress. Instead, go to Zeiss Bracer guild and talk to Kilika. She'll call the people at Leiston Fortress.--u--
(Thanks Sandfish95 and shingekinoeigo for the info. If you are playing the "Evo" version, it should be the same thing)

*Next, head to Tratt Plains Road, and head over to the wide open field towards Carnelia Tower
**There should be a large ship parked at the middle of the field. Talk to Captain Hoffman.

*Once you have the [[Combustion Engine]], go to Zeiss Central Factory at the basement floor and talk to Rudi
**Chief Murdock will come in and give you his letter

*Next, go all the way to Ruan and talk to Portos outside the Aqua Rossa Bar at the south block.
**Talk to Harg at the end of the pier. He should be standing right next to the crates right by the fishing spot. He'll give you 3 [[Gasoline Tanks]]

*Lastly, go back to Elmo Village and go inside the shed

''Boss: Big Cactus and Lark Cactus x8''

Lark Cactus will use Beast Spiritual to buff its Strength and Defense. Also, the lark Cactus will
use Devil Stinger to inflict seal against your ally. Big Cactus will just use Stinger to deal
damage. Pretty much the Lark Cactuses are the biggest threat in battle. Be sure to use arts with
wide range such as Abyss Fall or Death Scream. Also, use S-Craft such as Final Break 2, True
Aural Blast, or True Black Fang to deal damage. You should have this battle in the bag! You should
have [[Seal 2]] as your reward for defeating Big Cactus.

====Grancel Sewer Monster: Redux====

*[[Liberl: Grancel Region]]
**Mira: 9500

**Expires: After initiating the main sidequest "Danger in the Capital"

The location of this boss is at Grancel Sewer: East Block. Because it's a huge maze, I'll pull out
an excerpt from one of the segments from this walkthrough. So, you don't get lost in the process.

The location to the sewers is northeast of Grancel: East Block. The guy guarding the door will now let you in.
So, go straight down until you see a split path. If you go left, it'll lead to a
bunch of Scissor Hands along the roadside. The one on the right is much safer. There's a
door that leads east. We'll come back there for now. Continue to go forward until the split path merges, There,
you'll see two doors. head to the door you see on the right end of the map and
continue to move east.

On area 2, go straight until you see another intersection where you'll see a bunch of Boiled Egger O.
At the intersection where there are two wooden bridges, go to the one on your left. It should lead to the next area
the moment you enter.

On area 3, go straight until you see an intersection. Continue to move forward from the first
intersection. We'll come back at the same spot later. Anyway, you should arrive at a corridor
with two rooms. The first door nearest from the entrance will lead to a dead end. You should
find the boss at the end of the road.

=-----=
''Boss: Evil Stream x4''

It's similar to the Mouki Fight earlier in chapter I. The only difference is that it uses Grand Stream,
an all range wind art. Also, watch out for HP Absorb as well. So, counter their all-range arts with
your own using Death Scream. From there, just destroy them with your Chain Craft. Once you defeat
Evil Stream, it'll drop [[Death]].

''Boss: Vanguard x3 and Volgel EX 911 x3''

Yes, you have fought them at one point. The only thing you have to watch out for is the Gorgon Laser
from Volgel EX and Vanguard's devastating self-destruct. Be sure to use Joshua's True Black Fang

''Boss: Devil Spear x3''

Devil Spear's regular attack inflicts poison. Also, it has Grand Submariner which deals damage to
all of your allies regardless of range. Finally, it uses Death Press to inflict instant death against
you. If that was not enough, it'll be accompanied with a bunch of Mars Sparrows. First, take out
the weak enemies by using Joshua's True Black Fang. Next, use Chain Crafts and S-Craft to deal
damage against the Devil Spears. Personally, I would not worry about instant death in this battle
because it's a special move, not a regular attack. If you defeat the Devil Spears, you'll get
[[Confuse 2]].

====Save the Miners====
*[[Liberl: Rolent Region]]

''HIDDEN SIDEQUEST''


As soon you relinquish one of your ZFGs to Aina, head over to Malga Mine to start the sidequest.
Talk to Landan at the elevator at the end of the path. You'll fight a bunch of Killer Crabs on
the bottom Floor. Like the first game, you will need to rescue five people inside the mine.

On the second floor, head south past the mine cart rail. You should end up at the intersection
that splits into three paths. Head east, and you'll find two miners: Heinrich and Pierre. Back
at the intersection, head west and you'll find Miner Bones. Finally, go south at the intersection
and you'll find Miner Chief Gaton. Once you defeated the Killer Crabs, it's time to go back
to the starting point and move northwest. You'll find the monster nest as well as the next boss.

=-----=
''Boss: Armored Hydra''

The Armored Hydra will do several attacks. One, it'll use Stone Toss to deal heavy earth damage
to allies within range. Next, Armored Hydra will use Grand Flash to blind your allies. Finally,
it'll use Earth Shaker to deal earth damage to allies. Be careful when the Armored Hydra's health
is below 66%, it'll begin to turn blue. During that phase, the Armored Hydra will knock away
HP as well as EP and CP for each successive attack. Watch out for Killer Crabs because they
can summon reinforcements at any moment.

This battle could be tough considering you only have one ZFG in your possession. Whoever holds
the ZFG have to be the healer of the group. Anyway, you may have to be very aggressive in this
battle. Use Joshua's True Black Fang to destroy the killer crabs. Next, use S-Crafts such as
Beat Down 2, True Barrage, or True Aural Blast to deal damage against the Armored Hydra. Also,
use Chain-Crafts to deal big damage. The whole point of this battle is to deal significant
damage at a timely matter because the longer you stall the battle, you might exhaust your
resources. Once you defeat the Armored Hydra, it'll drop [[Topaz Gem]] at the end of the battle.

After you report your investigation findings to Aina, attend the wedding at Rolent Chapel.
After that, don't forget to talk to Serra at Abend bar on the first floor. She'll give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 11]]

====Sanktheim Gate: Before the Earthquake Investigation====
If you are going for this achievement, you need to follow this very carefully. Anton is a random NPC who appears in the most obscure places
throughout Liberl. To initiate this sidequest, you need to go to Sanktheim Gate --u--''before you investigate the Earthquake in Wolf Fort''--u--.
To find Anton, he's standing on top of the roof facing Ritter Roadway shouting his lungs off. His friend Ricky and Private Chesley should
be standing right by Anton. This is first of 16 of his dialogue.


Here are loose notes detailing what Drache belives is all Anton's appearances, which SHOULD include
all the ones that count for the achievement. (She got it while it was bugged.)

* Sankheim Gate
** ''Before earthquake investigation''
** ''During earthquake investigation'': Talk to Anton again at the same spot!
** After earthquake investigation
** After setting all three devices
** Before heading to Grancel (he says he's going there too!)

* South of Grancel Department Store:
** ''Beginning of Chapter 3''
** After finding Renne
** After speaking with both embassies and the queen. The sun must be setting.
** After Renne slips out.
** Before getting on the airship (at landing area)

* Rolent
** On the airship.
** At the landing port.
** Abend Bar, at night.
** Outside the Guild, the next day
** At the inn, after his request

* Grancel, Ch. 8
** As you pass by Grancel, he'll be in his usual spot
+
If you did it correctly, you should get the achievement. However, this will not be the last time you'll see him. He will show up in
Crossbell and Erebonia....

===Breakfast Safari===

First of all, they are not food items. They are actually pidgeons named after breakfast items.
There are a myriad of them, but we only want three of the pidgeons. Be careful, they are only
available in certain chapters. Here are the locations...

^l26|: Eggs, Golden Toast, and Bacon Location

* Erbe Royal Villa (Chapter 3)
** ''Eggs is located near the benches. Find him before the Embassy Mission.''

* Grancel: West Block (Chapter 3)
** ''Golden Toast is located in front of Grancel Chapel. You may want to walk inside and out of the chapel just to talk to one of the pidgeons.''

* Rolent: Clock Tower (Chapter 4)
** ''Bacon is located at the clock tower, third from the left. Be careful, he's only available at night.''

===Fishing===

''NOTE: Work in Progress''

In chapter I, be sure to talk to Lloyd inside the passenger cabin. He'll give you [[Fishing Book]] and [[Progress Rod]]. Once you arrive at City
of Ruan, you'll learn how to fish. First, choose a rod and a bait. The size of the fish depends on the bait and rod you use. For example, if you
use [[Heavy Trident Rod]], you'll catch large fishes based on the given bait. Once you chose your set-up, wait until you see the exclaimation point. Once you see the exclaimation
point, press the confirm button. Time your button presses correctly, and you'll catch a fish. Be warned that regardless the outcome of your fishing
attempt, it consumes a bait! Catch all of the fishes throughout Liberl and you'll get the achievement, ''Master Fisher''. Right below you, are the fishes
you can catch in every region!

--u--''TIP: Rather than looking for the exclaimation point above Estelle's head, HEAR the sound effect for the exclaimation
point! The moment you hear the sound, press the confirm button right away! Your chances of catching the fishes increases dramatically.''--u--
