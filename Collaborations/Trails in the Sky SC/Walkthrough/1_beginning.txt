==Battle System==

In Trails in the Sky, the battle system is similar to SRPGs. You are in a gridline battlefield fighting enemies.
However, the pacing is still Turn-based at heart. So, there's no need to place your movement towards your enemy and
fight. In SC, not much has changed aside from one additional game mechanic.

===Turn Order (Bonus Icons)===
If you look at your left, it indicates the order of the turns in battle. Occasionally, you'll see a bonus
icon right next to the ally or the enemy. These bonus icons will give you or your opponent an edge during
that turn. Also, you can bypass the turn order by using S-Break. The following below are 6 possible bonus icons.

|* Name             |* Effect                                              |
| Heal HP           | Recovers 10% or 50% of HP                            |
| Charge EP         | Recovers 10% or 50% of EP                            |
| CP UP             | Recovers 10% or 50% of CP                            |
| STR UP            | Increases Physical or Magic attack by 10% or 50%     |
| Crtical           | All Attack, Magic or Recovery effects increases 1.5X |
| Sepith UP         | Steals Sepith from Target                            |

===Craft and S-Break===

====CP (Craft Points)====
All characters possess CP. From the beginning of the battle, you start out with zero CP. The only way to
gain CP is to successfully attack or recieve damage from your opponent. Once you have gotten a sufficent
amount of CP, you can use those to use your Craft or even S-Craft at your disposal. You can accumulate
your CP and save it for later.

====Chain Craft====
This is the only new addition for SC. Basically, you can have 2-4 people attack your opponent in one turn.
In order to use chain craft, select Chain and choose your allies to assist you. You and your selected ally
must be in close proximity as well as your opponent. If you did it correctly, you can unleash 2-4 hits in
one turn. The only drawback is that your chosen ally will take the turn as well. So, use chain craft
wisely.

====Craft====
It's the character's special moves. They can be learned as they gain levels. All craft ablities take up
CP.

====S-Craft====
Think of it as this game's equivalent of Limit Break. Anytime you reach 100 CP, you can unleash their
powerful attack. But, there's a much more effective use for it....

====S-Break====
As stated earlier, you can use S-Break for cutting the next person's turn. But, you have to accumulate
a minimum of 100 CP to use it. When you do accumulate 100 CP, the orb on the HUD will glow red. Anyway,
during someone's turn, you can toggle left or right and press "X". However, it's perferable if you use
the shortcut command by pressing triangle and press the directional buttons on the d-pad. Once you
activate S-Break, you will unleash your S-Craft anywhere on the battlefield. This can be useful for
killing off those pesky enemies with "Self-Destruct" ability. Finally, if you have 200 CP, you
can dish out even more damage.

===Orbal Quartz===

====Sepith====
Each enemies drop sepith after you defeat them. You can save those up for Quartz or even sell it for
money.

====Quartz====
Since sepith comes in various forms, you can use those to make Quartz. For the most part, each of the
quartz can increase your parameters. Also, each time you equip a quartz, you gain arts. However, there's
a specific way on how to gain more arts.

====Slots and lines====
At the start of the game, there will be some slot closures and it's up to you to open those slots. To unlock
those slots, you must have the adequate amount of Sepiths. Please note that the slots have a specific trait.
For example, if you look at Joshua's slots, there are some slot that's Time Elemental only. Obviously, you
can only equip Time-Elemental quartz on that slot.

For all playable characters, they each have a central slot. Whatever quartz is in the central slot, they
will govern the elemental values. There are some characters who have only possess a single line while some have
various lines that branches out. The lines will add the overall elemental values equipped on each end. For those
who only has a single line can add more elemental values. With that, you'll have access to higher level arts.


===Bracers Guild===

This is practically the bulk of the game. All quests start out in the guild. By doing those quests, you are
rewarded with money, items and etc. Also, BP (Bracer Points) will be added on your overall tally. The more BP you
have, the higher your rank will be. Finally, if you have made the right decisions during the dialogue or you have
been proactive towards certain missions, you can gain extra BP. This will be extra useful especially if you are
going for the perfect score...

===Misc===

====Cooking====
Even though Estelle is not the best cook out there, she can still pull of those dishes in a pinch. To obtain those
dishes, you must first eat the food to gain the recipe. Once you have the recipe, be sure to have the right ingredients
and cook it. For the most part, it recovers HP, EP or CP with some temporary increase in parameters. So, don't neglect
it!

====Fishing====
If you remember that one-time minigame from FC, then you'll be happy to hear that it is a full-fledged minigame in SC.
Cast your rod into water and wait for the right time to reel your catch.

==Tips and Tricks==

Like all the other games out there, here are some tricks of the trade for you to survive this game.

1)--u--'''''Multiple saves is a must'''''--u--

For the completionist people out there, this is mandatory. There's a bunch of hidden quests waiting to be uncovered. Even the most minor
implication during your major quest could screw you over for the rest of the game. So, every time you are about attempt something significant, make sure
you make another save file before moving on.

(P.S. If you make an oopsie the game does keep a small amount of autosaves.)

2)--u--'''''Relax and decide your next move'''''--u--

I know what you did there. You have done something that cost you extra BP and chances are your last save is over 5 hours long. Regardless your outcome,
there's always an option: either go back to your last save file and work from there or you decide to move on. If you decided to do the latter, there's always
New Game+. You can always make up the lost BP from the last playthough.

3)--u--'''''Take the time to explore around'''''--u--

If you decide to get BP honestly, I suggest you look around and talk to NPC before the next major mission. Many of the hidden items and quest all happen
within the small time frame. Also, Rushing through the game can work against you for the same reason.

4)--u--'''''The Bracer Notebook is your bible'''''--u--

Seriously, the contents inside his really comprehensive. It has all the notes you need such as your quest progress, Arts and quartz elemental
values. It even has most of the basic stuff covered in the manual. If there's something you want to know, it's likely inside
the Bracer's Notebook. Don't be afraid to look up something once in a while.

===Playable Characters===
''NOTE: Work in progress! Characters who appeared in FC will continue to be analyzed to see any gameplay changes.''

====Estelle Bright====
'''She is the daughter of the legendary Bracer Cassius Bright. Because of her jovial
personality, she'll perservere even if the odds are against her.'''

Estelle is one of the characters that's available for entire game for obvious reasons. She is a versatile character,
and her orbment slots can use every elements available. As far
as orbal arts combination goes, she's can insert several mid-level magics in one line. However, putting some of the demanding
arts such as Titanic Roar, Volcanic Rave and etc. in one line could be difficult. Her crafts are pretty diverse overall.

Her versatility does not end in magic spells. Her crafts have a diverse moveset and are useful in various situations.
For example, she has morale to raise her allies stats in battle.
Also, she learns a crowd control attack early on in the game as well as a skill that interupts the foe's spell casting.
Her S-Craft such as Barrage and Pummel are useful against a single opponent. It is recommended to use it
against bosses. Her only drawback is that specialized characters such as Olivier, Kloe or Agate
overshadow her versatile abilities. Other than that, she's a well-rounded character due to being the protagonist.
She has a lot of tools in her disposal and has flexible orbal moveset.

====Anelace Elfead====
'''A young woman who is a senior bracer. Although she is a few years older than Estelle, she has a bubbly personality and
a weakness for cute objects.'''

Like Estelle, Anelace is a well-rounded character. She has a wide variety of crafts she can use in the battlefield. For example,
she can use fallen leaves to knockback her opponent for a few turns. She can also use Petal Dance to give her a great strength
buff with the cost of her defense. Her art usage is servicable at best because she has three lines on her orbment slots. She
can do basic arts, but that's as far as she can go. You may have to rely more on her crafts than her arts. She could be a great
person to have as a group, but she only appears on the prologue! So, don't get too attached with her.

====Agate Crosner====
'''A young, burly Bracer who wields a broad sword. He tends to look down on Junior Bracers.'''

In contrast to FC, you have the option to choose him or Scherazard at the start of chapter I. He's definitely a great asset
to the group because of his exceptional strength and his unique moveset. For instance, he is the only character who can raise his CP
with the cost of his max HP. If he does not have enough CP, he can use Wild Rage 2 for the first turn and use S-break after he uses Wild Rage.
He has some attacks such as Draguna Edge and Flame Edge to deal damage against a group of foes. It also helps that Draguna Edge
has a much wider line compared to the other character's line attack. He also has Sprial Edge which inflicts AT delay to a single
foe. But his S-Craft is exceptionally useful. Regardless if it's a single attack (Beat Down) or a group attack (Final Break) the
damage will be devastating. However his raw power does come with a price. He has one the worst magic defense in the game.
His arts are very limited due to having multiple branches on his orbal quartz. So, you are pretty much going to use
his Orbal Slots for raising his parameters. Overall, you going to use Agate as your frontline attacker. With Wild Rage 2, you are
going to use his S-Craft frequently.

====Scherazard Harvey====
'''Nicknamed "The Silver Streak", she is former disiple of the legendary Bracer. Though she is
an intelligent person and uses Tarot Cards for divinity purposes, she is a heavy drinker'''

Like Agate, Scherazard can be used as early as Chapter I. She specializes on wind arts and deals mid-range
She can certainly deal damage. Her whip is medium range; meaning that her range is far enough to prevent
her from getting hit from self destruct. Her moveset are okay to use. Her first craft can deal damage to a small
group of foes. Her bind whip is useful because she has the ability to mute spell casters. Finally, her
Heaven's Kiss can increase her allies speed. For the most part, she is average. She's really useful
early game. But once late game comes in, she is pretty much outclassed by her other peers.

====Kevin Graham====
'''He is a priest from a far away land. Under his gentle smile, his reasons of coming to Liberl is currently unknown'''

Similar to Olivier, Kevin uses a long-range weapon. His main element is time, which allows him to use time arts at its
highest potential. Interestingly, he has two lines but one of them only has one orbal slot. Use slot 2 for any stat
enhancement. You want to focus on line one because this is where you'll want to increase magic capabilities. This will
allow him to use any high level arts. Although his crafts are limited, they serve a different purpose. For example, his
Sacrifical Arrow can redistribute his CP to other party members within range. Also, his S-Craft is not like the other
characters. For example, his Grail Sphere grants immunity to incoming attacks for one turn. This is extremely useful
for battles because you can withstand a catastrophic attack. If you have 200 CP, you are immune to damage until the enemy attacks
you twice. His only drawback is lousy move stat and strength. Other than that, Kevin is a great character to use.

====Olivier Lenheim====
''' Coming from an Eberonian background, he travels south to play music for the citizens of Liberl.
With his charismatic personality, he tends to hit on anyone he sees.'''

His defining personality is his charisma; although it won't help much in battle. Anyway, he's one of the few characters
that uses long range weapon. Also, his main element is mirage, which is a neutral element. Having mirage will enable him
to configure several magic combination. Because he only has a single line in his orbal slot setup, he has access to
the high level arts. Having a neutral element along with a flexible orbal configuration benefits Olivier's playstyle.

His crafts on the other hand also useful as well. His Quick Draw has the ability to hit the target where you wanted it.
Because of his range, his Snipe Shoot can easily take out the spell casters. Finally, his Happy Trigger can cure
people within range. Although it's minimal, his CP consumption is really low. He only has one S-Craft in the game and
the damage is mediocre. His weaknesses is are low HP, low Defense and limited movement.
Ironically, Olivier has the lowest magical defense in the game considering him possessing one of the highest Magic Attack power in the game.
Overall, Oliver is another effective character to use. You really can't go wrong with diverse arts as well as utilitarian
moveset. Plus with his range, he can be a threat in the battlefield.


====Kloe Rinz====
'''A second year student in Jenis Academy. She is a very sweet young woman who have a mutual understanding
with her pet Gryfalcon, Sieg.'''

She specializes on healing magic as evidenced by her water affinity. Also, she does possess a single line orbal
slot. However, her customization is somewhat limited because three of her orbal slots are Water only. Therefore, she needs to rely
on water arts to be useful. Her craft is minimal at best becayse she only has two regular crafts and one S-craft at her disposal. She has
Kaempfer (Impose) which debuffs the foe's STR and DEF andSturm  (Encroach) which interupts the person's spell casting time. But compared to the other
characters, her Encroach needs to hit up close in order to be effective. Finally, her Radiant Plash has the largest healing range out of
everyone. It's already great on its own considering the amount of HP it restores plus it also revives allies as well. If you use it at 200 EP, not only it
does more recovery, it gives out free Defense buff. Overall, despite of Kloe's restrictive orbal customization, her usefulness certainly lies with
her healing powers. Also, having the highest EP as well as high magic attack power, she can be the magical powerhouse of the group.
