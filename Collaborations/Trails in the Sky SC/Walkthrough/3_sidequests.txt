====Come, Ingredient Hunters====

* [[City of Ruan]]
** Mira: 1500 (+1000)
** BP: 2 (+1)
** Timeframe: Long
** Expires: -

Talk to Orvid on the second floor of the Magnolia Inn. He'll give you a list of ingredients, but he has them all. Your main objective is to find
ingredients that are NOT part of the list! You only need to find three missing ingredients to satisfy the quest. However, we are going an extra mile and find all six
missing ingredients. After all, we have extra BP at stake.

I hope you have the [[Luck]] Quartz. This will be very useful considering that the following ingredients are monster drops. Please note that --u--''whoever is
holding the luck quartz, make sure that person gets the final blow against a certain monster. This will increase the chances of finding the items you need''--u--
Anyway, here's a table for the missing ingredients.

|* Ingredient        |* Monster and Location |
| [[Juicy Bone]]     | Seahorse Demon in Sapphirl Tower |
| [[Lucky Fang]]     | Guard Boar in Vista Forest Road or Aurian Causeway / Wrap Spider in Underground Ruins |
| [[Tender Poultry]] | Roadrunner in Vista Forest Road or Aurian Causeway / Ballbat in Underground Ruins |
| [[Fish Egg]]       | Crocodark in Gull Seaside Way |
| [[Bird Egg]]       | Roadrunner in Vista Forest Road or Aurian Causeway / Ballbat in Underground Ruins |
| [[Curative Horn]]  | Helmet Crab in Sapphirl Tower |

Remember, he only needs one sample of each of the missing ingredients. Also, you have until the end of chapter to finish this quest. If you have all six missing
ingredients, you get twenty [[Savory Pinion]].

====Sapphirl Tower Photo====

*[[City of Ruan]]
**Mira: 2000 (+1000)
**BP: 1 (+2)
**Timeframe: Medium
**Expires: After the end of Chapter I

Talk of Santos at the first floor of Hotel Blanche on the first room from the left side of the entrance. Go to the Sapphirl Tower and take the picture at the pedestal.
I suggest that you put off this sidequest until you have Dorothy in your party. The reason why this is important because the quality of the photograph
gives you bonus BP. Having Dorothy do the photograph will give you the most optimal results. The only drawback is to babysit Dorothy for the entire dungeon.

Anyway, when you get to the top floor, stand on this spot as shown on this image. Once Estelle is about to take a picture, she'll ask Dorothy to take
the picture! --u--''LET DOROTHY TAKE THE PHOTO''--u-- After that, show it to Santos in Hotel Blanche. If you did it correctly, the photograph should look
colorful and vivid. Santos will give you [[Moonglasses]] as your reward. Report your results to Jean.

^l2|A: Photo spot!

====Vista Forest Road Monster====

*[[City of Ruan]]
**Mira: 1500
**BP: 2
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

The location of the boss is in the 2nd area of Vista Forest Rd. The boss is rght at the southern perimeter of the O-shaped path.

=-----=
''Boss: Mercury Viper x2''

It only does two things: move around at random positions and spew venom at a distance. Obviously, whoever gets hit by the venom will be poisoned.
If you have been vigilant with your bracer ranking, you should have items with poison resistance such as Silver Chain or Earring. Just kill it
with your normal attacks. If you have Kevin with you, use him as your primary healer. It's a really easy battle.
=-=
%
====Gull Seaside Way Monster====

*[[City of Ruan]]
**Mira: 2500
**BP: 3
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

When you arrive Gull Seaside Way from Ruan, there's a sandy landmass at the center of the road. There should be a monster guarding the narrow pathway.

=-----=
''Boss: Cobalt Saber x3''

These monsters have high physical defense. Not only they hit very hard, but they can inflict poison as well. If one of the Cobalt Sabers fall, they will use
Death Throes as their last resort. This will give the remaining allies a significant defense and agility buff. I suggest that you wait until you get Kevin
or another plot related character to beat this battle. If you are willing to beat them with only two people, be sure to use arts with a wide area of effect.

====Lighthouse Test Run====

*[[Mercia Orphanage and Manoria Village]]
**Mira: 1000 (+500)

As soon you can leave Ruan, immediately go to Varenne Lighthouse! Head to the top floor of the lighthouse and talk to Vogt.
He'll give you a bonus BP question. Choose --u--''is there something you need done?''--u-- Once you are ready, do the following.

=-----=
*Set stabilizer to ''low''

*Switch orbal amplitude to ''mid''
*Set stabilizer to ''mid''.

''Boss: Ash Saber x3''

This boss is very speedy and do considerable damage to your allies. Each attack blocks off S-Craft and stun you for two turns.
Like Cobalt Saber, it uses Death Throes to temporary boost their attack and speed. Although Dorothy is capable of blinding her opponents,
she is the most liable of the group. Your foes usually target Dorothy whenever they are within the vicinity. So, defeat your opponents
quickly by using physical attacks. Any moves with AT delay will help you tremendously. Lastly, be sure to use Olivier's happy trigger to heal
your allies.

Central Factory and go on the 5th floor. From there, go to Central Factory: Operation room and examine CAPEL in the center of the room. Choose Central Factory,
then Universal Tech, and choose Bracer Guild Sign. Next, go back to town and head over to Forgel Bar. Do not enter the bar. Instead, examine the three metal chimneys

reward.

for attacks like Flash Strike which inflicts AT delay to your ally or Flying Orders which attack any foes from a distance. Whatever you do, don't
let Cid cast Arc Prominence because it's an all-range attack that deals severe damage to your allies. So, use any attacks that interupts casting.
If you won all three battles, you get two extra BP as well as [[Gladiator Headband]]. This is a very good accessory to have because it gradually
increases CP as the battle goes on. Anyway, report it to Kilika.

ally. Also, the creepy sheep inflicts sleep the moment they attack your ally. You are going have to wait for a while until all the creepy sheeps fuse into big
sheep. You cannot attack them because they have high defense and evasion. When it becomes big sheep, he deals heavy damage by using Super Whirlwind Spiral Kick
and Super Sheep Punch which inflicts confuse. When its health is close to 33%, it'll unleash Super Baaad touch which hits any ally within its vicinity. At first,

=-----=
''Boss: Cronocider x5''

Cronocider is fairly resilient because it has golden armor which increases strength and defense. Also, its normal attack inflicts faint and pushes your ally to the edge of the battlefield.
Even though the battle is straight forward, you still want to be careful becuase the Cronocider deal significant damage. Use Chain or S-Craft when necessary. Other than that, you should
be fine.

Once the Mad Tree is close enough, it'll deal damage and absorb health at the same time. Mad Trees have high HP, so you need to clear the enemy field as quickly as possible. By now, you
should have chain 2 because the enemies like to crowd in a lot. Use wide area of effect arts like Spiral Flare or Aero Storm and use S-Craft when necessary. This battle is tough, so
keep at it.

====The Missing Exhibit====

*[[Grancel and Grancel Sewers]]
**Mira: 5000
**BP: 4
**Timeframe: Short
**Expires: -

(Thanks Eskadoodle for correcting the actual BP value)

To begin this sidequest, head over to the East Block at Grancel and go northwest towards Grancel Landing station entrance. There should be a building on the left side saying "The History
Museum." Remember, it's next to the Grancel landing station. Anyway, talk to the Museum Director. The location of the first clue is on Grancel: West Block. There should be a small house
next door to Grancel Cathedral. It happens to be General Morgan's Residence. Go to the second floor and --u--''examine the grandfather clock''--u--. Next, go to Grancel: South Block and
--u--''examine the back end bird fountain statue near the front of the entrance.''--u-- Finally, go to Granel: East Block and enter the Calavardian Embassy at the southern most end of the map.
Climb the first set of stairs and go to the room on your right. Examine the bookshelf in the center and --u--''Read Chapter 15 of Doll Knight''--u--. Finally, head out of the Embassy, and
go to the Grand Arena, which is located at the eastern end of the map. Once you are in the grand arena, go forward. You'll end up at the arena itself. You'll fight a boss at the end of the battle.
Prepare yourself with equipping anti-freeze accessories.

=-----=
''Boss: Master Cryon and Cryon Bits''

Master Cryon casts Diamond Dust and nothing else. The Cryon Bits are more of a threat because it can inflict Freeze to any of your allies. This battle is pretty annoying, so use Fire Arts
like Spiral Flare to deal significant damage. Other than that, you'll be alright.

Go straight until you see an intersection, head to the first door on your left. From there, go forward
until you see wooden pathway on the left side. This leads to the monster you are
looking for.

=-----=
''Boss: Gundoll x3''

Despite of its intimidating look, the battle is not hard at all. Gundoll only does three things: shoot its
heavy machine gun from a distance, heal and call reinforcements. Gundolls summon Boiled Egger O for your
convenience. Anyway, use wide area of effect arts, chain crafts and S-Crafts and the battle will be
over in no time.

====Royal Avenue Monster====

*[[Post-Chapter III Sidequest]]
**Mira: 3500

This boss is easy to find because it's the only monster on the road. Anyway, from Grancel, move east towards
Grune Gate. On the second area where there's a signpost saying Erbe Scenic Route, go south. You should see
Flame Velgr at the end of the road.
=-----=
''Boss: Flame Velgr x4''

You may have fought it at Carnelia Tower earlier in chapter 2. It has the same moveset such as Feather
Shower which hits a large area of effect and Rolling Dive as its special attack. What makes it menacing
is that it's accompanied by Hell Mars which unleashes Mars Star as its special attack. The most threatening
part of this battle is overwhelming you in sheer numbers. So, you need to take out Flame Velgrs by
using water arts and S-Crafts. You can kill the Hell Star quickly using regular arts.

====Elize Highway Monster====

*[[City of Rolent]]
**Mira: 4500
**BP: 4
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

The location of the boss is at the very end of the road towards Gurune Gate in Elize Highway. You'll fight
this boss.

=-----=
''Boss: Wisdom x2''

It casts Shadow Spear and uses absorb nutrients to sap away HP to one of your allies. It's also accompanied
with several monsters as well. Take out the enemy mob first and then exterminate the Wisdoms one at a time.
Prioritize on one of the Wisdom and concentrate your attack against it. This will prevent the battle from
dragging on for too long. So, use Chain and S-Craft to deal damage.

====Milch Main Road Monster====

*[[City of Rolent]]
**Mira: 4500
**BP: 4
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

You cannot miss this monster. It's hanging out at the main road near Verte Bridge entrance.

=-----=
''Boss: Snowfoot x3''

This boss only does three things: heavy hitter, Knock Down and uses Snow Breath. What Snow Breath does is that it starts
itself by charging and unleash moderate damage to allies. It also inflicts freeze as well. Once its close to
death, it'll charge again and use knock down instead which deals heavy damage. It's really slow so overwhelm
them with your attacks.

====Search for Lost Cat====

*[[Rolent: Nightfall]]
**Mira: 2500
**BP: 3
**Timeframe: Short
**Expires: After the events in Rolent: Nightfall

Your window for this sidequest is extremely limited. Do this sidequest immediately as soon as the city gets dark.
Anyway, head over to Hotel Rolent and talk to Ida on the first floor. Then go to the landing port and talk to
Fabree near the airship dock. Then head downstairs and go to the warehouse behind the airship. Skip should
be hanging out at the corridor in between the warehouse and the landing port. Quint is not inside the Abend
Bar. He's in Melder Orbal Factory right across the guild. Finally, go back to the landing port and find
Zosimov. Face north and Zosimov is on --u--the first tree on your left near the entrance--u--. After talking
to Zosimov, talk to Fabree to look inside the airship. Once you are inside the airship cabin, go all the way
down to the bottom floor of the airship. You'll find the lost cat. If you have max BP or did the sidequest,
"Lost Cat" in FC, you'll get [[Master Beads]]

Drache once adopted a cat that soon after had a bunch of kitties. They were born in a trash can. She clearly wanted
to have them underneath the house, but we blocked off the way so the trash can must have been second best or something.

====Esmelas Tower Monster====

*[[Mistwald]]
**Mira: 5000
**BP: 4
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

The location of the boss is at the base of Esmelas Tower past the Malga Trail.

=-----=
''Boss: Thunder Quake x3''

World Shaker is an a special attack that hits everyone on the battlefield. However, Thunder Quake
is extremely weak against Earth. However, Coral Shell will protect them by simply placing itself
right next to the Thunder Quakes. Do any area of effect arts, and they'll reflect it back to
to you. You need to take out Coral Shell ASAP because they'll protect Thunder Quake from incoming art attacks.
They'll be a bigger nuisance to your team than the Thunder Quake. So, use your S-Craft against
the coral shell. Next, use strong earth arts to take down Thunder Quake.

%

====Milch Main Road Monster 2====

*[[Mistwald]]
**Mira: 6000
**BP: 5
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

The location of this monster is on the second area of Milch Main Road. At the signpost that directs you to
Perzel Farm, there should a Horse-like figure behind the signpost.

=-----=
''Boss: Picorn x4 and Death Specular x2''

Both Picorn and Death Specular uses Wii-O-Wisp which does moderate damage but inflicts confusion. They
will spam this move throughout the battle, so have your Lily Necklace ready to prevent confusion. Also,
the Picorn will use Plasma Wave to deal additional damage to your allies. This battle isn't so hard
if your allies are immune to confusion. So, do your usual tactics and get through the battle.

====Nostalgic Recipe====

*[[Post-Chapter IV Sidequests]]
**Mira: 2500
**BP: 4
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

''NOTE: Finishing this quest will earn you a steam achievement''

To begin this sidequest, head over to Abend Bar and talk to Densel inside the kitchen. Then talk to
Radford; he should be standing at the counter right next to the bartender. After learning about
some the ingredients, head over to Rinon's General Goods and talk to Bloom on the second floor.
Next, go to the house next door to Abend Bar and talk to Rhett as his private library on the second
floor. Examine the bookshelf on the upper right hand corner of the room for [[Recipe Copy]]. You will need these ingredients.


|* Ingredient        |*Quantity |* Location             |
| [[Aged Miso]]      |  ''1''   | Rinon General Goods   |
| [[Vintage Wine]]   |  ''1''   | Rinon General Goods   |
| [[Maple Sugar]]    |  ''2''   |  Rinon General Goods  |
| [[Kibbled Salt]]   |  ''5''   |  Rinon General Goods  |
| [[Fresh Herb]]     |  ''5''   | Rinon General Goods   |
| [[Dragon Beans]]   |  ''2''   | Rinon General Goods   |
| [[Black Pepper]]   |  ''4''   | Rinon General Goods   |
| [[Juicy Bone]]     |  ''2''   | You should have this from other monsters in previous chapters; otherwise fight Dirty Rats inside the Rolent Sewers |

After gathering all of the ingredients, talk to Densel and report your findings back to the guild. You
should learn [[Pepper Pottage]] recipe and earned yourself a steam achievement

====Diaset's Secret====

*[[Post-Chapter IV Sidequests]]
**Mira: 7500
**BP: 2
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

To begin this sidequest, head over to the Rolent Clock Tower and talk to Anton. If you are doing the odyssey of
Anton, this will count as another conversation. Anyway, you will need to gather the following ingredients:

|* Ingredient            |*Quantity |* Location                      |
| [[Monster Carapace]]   |  ''5''   | Coral Shell in Esmelas Tower   |
| [[Savory Pinon]]       |  ''5''   | Red Insectos in Malga Trail    |
| [[Prickly Seed]]       |  ''5''   | Mantrap in Milch Main Road     |
| [[Pearlglass]]         |  ''1''   | Fishing spot in Elize Highway, Mistwald, or Milch Main Road |

Assuming that you were diligent from doing the other sidequests in the previous chapters you should have adequate amount of
Monster Carapace, Savory Pinion, and Prickly Seed in your possession. Your main concern is the Pearlglass. It's a large fish
located in one of the three fishing spots. Generally, you have the best chance of catching Pearlglass by using the [[Bamboo Fishing Rod]]
and river snail as your bait. If you do not have it, you may want to use your default rod and use earthworm.
Your chances are slim, but you can tell you caught a big fish if the wait time is much longer than usual. Once you have
all of the ingredients, present it to Anton. After a long cutscene, report to Aina even though she witnessed Anton's
antics. :P

====Mine Commission====

To begin this sidequest, head over to house on the west side Rolent right behind the Orbal Shop. Proceed to the second floor and
talk to Gaton. Again, you are going to have to put up with Bleublanc's riddles like you did on the previous chapters. Anyway,
go to Rolent Chapel and go to the second floor. You should arrive at the balcony where the bench faces the altar. --u--''Examine
the red chair next to the door''--u--. Next, go to the Mayor's residence and --u--''examine the five boxes on the south wall
of the mayor's house''--u--. The next riddle is located behind Elger's Arm and Guards. --u--''examine the dirty forge below

[[Rusted Key]] and you'll find a bunch of Moukis. Defeat them and you'll resume your search. Examine the wooden cabinet next
to the fire torch. You'll find [[Ore Mine Commission Letter]]. Talk to Gaton and he'll reward you x500 Sepith of your choice.
Report this back to Aina.

Head over to Anterose Restaurant, which is next door to Bose Bracer Guild house and talk to Reina next to the entrance.

go to the room on the left side. You'll find Felicity near the fireplace. You'll have a bonus BP question coming up.
Choose --u--''You are really a coward, Felicity''--u--. After a long winded dialogue, Reina will give you [[Tornado Fan]]
as one of your rewards.

====The Rarest Flavor====

*[[City of Bose]]
**Mira: 5500 (+1500)
**BP: 3 (+2)
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: -

To begin this sidequest, head over to the Anterose and talk to Gwen at the kitchen.
After you accept her offer, you will need to gather the following ingredients:

|* Ingredient            |*Quantity  |* Location                      |
| [[Tender Poultry]]     |  ''10''   | Hresvelgr in Eisen Road   |
| [[Bird Eggs]]          |  ''10''   | Rock Pecker in East Bose Highway    |
| [[Gummy Eyeball]]      |  ''10''   | Boiled Egger G in Krone Trail     |
| [[Juicy Bone]]         |  ''5''    | Talk to Orvid at the south exit of Bose Market     |
| [[Curative Horn]]      |  ''5''    | Talk to Orvid at the south exit of Bose Market     |
| [[Lucky Fang]]         |  ''5''    | Talk to Orvid at the south exit of Bose Market    |

I assume that you already have all of those ingredients when you fought monsters in the previous chapters.
However, there's another bonus BP at stake. Before you present the ingredients to Gwen, --u--''talk to
Orvid at the south exit of Bose Market''--u--. If you talk to Orvid, you'll see a cutscene with him
and Gwen. This states that you got the bonus BP for this sidequest.

Mines. On the first intersection go north and you'll find the boss at the end of the path. Before you
start, be sure to equip Anti-petrification accessories such as Mirage Ring or T-Anklet.

=-----=
''Boss: Fate Spinner x3''

It uses Meadow Tusk to deal heavy damage plus petrify. Also, it uses Leap Upon to stop any incoming art attacks.
That's pretty much the extent of the boss battle. If all of your allies are immune to Petrify, you should be good
to go. Use your strongest attacks as always.

SURE THAT YOU DO NOT ENGAGE ANY ENCOUNTER WITH THE ENEMY''--u--. To minimalize the risk, make sure you
equip Heaven's Eye to spot enemies on the minimap and equip Haze or Yin-Yang to prevent enemies
approaching you. By escorting to Ravennue Village safely without any enemy encounters will give you
bonus BP. Anyway, talk to Mirano near the West Bose Highway and go to Ravennue Village. Once

You fought different variations of them back in chapter 7. The S-Series Doom throws
their axes two times and inflicts deathblow against your ally. Also, Guard Minion
use La Teara to heal extensive wounds. This battle is really easy once everyone
has deathblow resistance! Treat this as a normal battle. It'll drop [[Strike 2]]

''HIDDEN SIDEQUEST''

To trigger this sidequest, you will need to relinquish one of your Zero Field Generator to
Jean. He'll inform you to check out the neighboring areas around Ruan. What he means is that
check out Jenis Royal Academy! On your way to Jenis Academy, you'll engage battle against
two Blade Cougars! Don't forget to protect Mickey while you are fighting the Blade Cougars.

Next, Joshua will have infiltrate the school on his own. So, examine all of the windows
throughout the the perimeter of the school. Be sure to get a conversation from Hans and Jill
before you go. Next, take the back gate towards the Old School House and you'll return
with your allies. Also, this is the only time Anelace and Kurt will join the battle as
guest party members! Your next mission is to rescue all the hostages. These are the places
where you will find the hostages.

|*-2 Clubhouse      | Girl's Locker Room         | Deborah, Ms. Wiola, and Ms. Millia  (You'll get Mighty Essence along the way) |
                    | Boy's Locker Room          | Mr. Effort and Mr. Ratio |
|*-4 Schoolhouse    | Dean's Office              | Dean Collins and Fauna |
                    | Humanities Classroom       | Jill, Hans, Kaden, Alice, and Purity |

After rescuing everyone on the list above, it's time to rescue Richelle. She's located at the
old schoolhouse at the back of the academy. You'll engage battle against Gilbert. Honestly, this battle
is such a joke. While Gilbert employs the same tactic against you back in Chapter VI, he does
everything at a comical matter. So, just do your usual tactics and you are done with it. After the
battle is over, Kurt and Anelace :( will leave your party. Report your mission to Jean after
retaking the Jenis Academy. Don't forget to get the book, [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 12]] at the Humanities
Classroom before you go.

====Tratt Plains Monster: Redux====
*[[Liberl: Zeiss Region]]
**Mira: 6500
**BP: 5
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: After initiating the main sidequest "Danger in the Capital"

The location of this boss is not in the middle of nowhere in contrast to the other two monster quests
earlier in Chapter II. Anyway, the location of the boss is on side of the main road towards Wolf Fort. It's
a big worm, so you can't miss it!

=-----=
''Boss: Abyss Worms x8''

If you recall from chapter II, the Abyss Worm will use Lightning Fall to deal moderate damage from a distance.
However, once its HP is less than 100%, it's going to spam Earth Shaker like no tomorrow. It sucks dealing
with four Abyss Worms. Now, let's see if you can deal with eight of them! This can be a very difficult battle
if you are not careful. However, the Abyss Worm will --u--''NOT USE EARTH SHAKER IF ITS AT FULL HEALTH!''--u--
Having said that, I'm sure that your party members can take on a few lightning bolts. Anyway, the key of beating this battle is to
manipulate the turn order against your opponent. Also, observe how the Abyss Worm's movement throughout the
battlefield. If a bunch of them begin to crowd around each other, this could be an golden opportunity to deal
substantial damage. But, that depends on your party set up!

At the start of the battle, make sure that someone is casting Clock UP EX to increase your ally's agility by
50%. Next, cast Clock Down to drastically reduce their agility! Then cast Earth Guard to ensure that your allies
will be okay against their attack. From there, you can go offensive against the worms. You can do this one at a
time, but you run at a risk of exhausting your resources in the process. If you are going to deal with them one
at a time, make sure your physical characters will deal damage while Joshua casts Evil Eye to discourage other
Abyss Worms to attack you.

Personally, I prefer to attack them in clusters! Because Zane is my main attacker, he was responsible of dealing
most of the damage against the worms. First, I use True Distend to raise his STR and DEF by 60%. I also have Estelle
casting Clock UP EX on Zane while someone else can cast Clock Down on the worms the following turn. Make sure that
Joshua is delaying his opponent's turn by using Evil Eye. He should not be doing anything else during this phase.
If you know that the Abyss Worms are crowding around each other, it's time to use Thunder God Kick. If you managed
to get up to five worms inside the small circle, execute it right away. If you are playing the PC version, the damage
is devastating plus you get extra hits depending how many worms that was inside the circle. Using Thunder God Kick
should be the main offense against the worms. However, if you are playing the PSP version, the damage should be significant
as well. You need another character to facilitate the damage.

Agate should deal damage as well by using Wild Rage 2 and Final Break 2 attack as well. DO NOT USE DRAGON DIVE unless
you are confident enough to take on all eight worms at once. Tita should act as support and use arts and a bit of
S-Craft as well. If you are using Scherazard, you can use her Wind arts and Heaven's Whip to prioritize your allies
turns. Finally, use Chain Crafts to deal damage, but do not choose Joshua as your co-attacker. He needs to lock down
on the worms using Evil Eye. Whatever set up you have, make sure that the Abyss Worm's speed is reduced while Joshua
is casting Evil Eye on each turn. Once you have the worms under control, you should get [[Poison 2]] as one of the
dropped items.

The way Drache did it was to nuke the crap out of them, though this isn't the "proper" way. Get as high ATS
as possible and start with 200 CP. Zero attacking during Clock Up setup, but after that hit everything on
the field as hard as you can.

=-----=
''Boss: Blade Cougar x5''

Chances are, you probably encountered these guys back at Jenis Academy. These guys use Seal Blade
to inflict seal against your allies. Also, it uses Wind Blade to deal moderate damage while
traversing to the other end of the field. Finally, it uses Death Blade to deal Deathblow to
one of your allies. This should be a easy battle considering you have experience fighting the
Cougars. By defeating the boss, it'll drop [[Blind 2]].

After you gave the ZFG to Kilika, she'll tell you about the incident at Elmo Village. Bring Tita
along and head over to Elmo Village. Go to the Maple Leaf Inn and talk to Mao. You need to talk to
her twice and choose offer her help anyway. Mao will give you the Pump Shed Key. The Pump Shed
is located at the outskirts of town near the entrance to the Hot Springs Cave. Tita will inform
you that you will have to make a combustion engine. In other words, you need to do a lot of
walking around. So, you will have to do the following. BTW, I suggest you equip Cloak and Night Goggles
because you will do a lot of walking.

=-----=
*Head back to Zeiss and go to the Landing Port. Talk to Gustav, who is wearing the orange jumpsuit with blue hair.

*Go to Leiston Fortress and talk to Private Samuel about the combustion engine.
**''UPDATE:'' --u--You don't have to walk to Leiston Fortress. Instead, go to Zeiss Bracer guild and talk to Kilika. She'll call the people at Leiston Fortress.--u--
(Thanks Sandfish95 and shingekinoeigo for the info. If you are playing the "Evo" version, it should be the same thing)

*Next, head to Tratt Plains Road, and head over to the wide open field towards Carnelia Tower
**There should be a large ship parked at the middle of the field. Talk to Captain Hoffman.

*Once you have the [[Combustion Engine]], go to Zeiss Central Factory at the basement floor and talk to Rudi
**Chief Murdock will come in and give you his letter

*Next, go all the way to Ruan and talk to Portos outside the Aqua Rossa Bar at the south block.
**Talk to Harg at the end of the pier. He should be standing right next to the crates right by the fishing spot. He'll give you 3 [[Gasoline Tanks]]

*Lastly, go back to Elmo Village and go inside the shed

Once you have the pump fixed, Mao will give you [[Nirvana Tea]] as your reward. After a series of running back and forth, report back to the guild! :/

''Boss: Big Cactus and Lark Cactus x8''

Lark Cactus will use Beast Spiritual to buff its Strength and Defense. Also, the lark Cactus will
use Devil Stinger to inflict seal against your ally. Big Cactus will just use Stinger to deal
damage. Pretty much the Lark Cactuses are the biggest threat in battle. Be sure to use arts with
wide range such as Abyss Fall or Death Scream. Also, use S-Craft such as Final Break 2, True
Aural Blast, or True Black Fang to deal damage. You should have this battle in the bag! You should
have [[Seal 2]] as your reward for defeating Big Cactus.

====Grancel Sewer Monster: Redux====

*[[Liberl: Grancel Region]]
**Mira: 9500
**BP: 5
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: After initiating the main sidequest "Danger in the Capital"

The location of this boss is at Grancel Sewer: East Block. Because it's a huge maze, I'll pull out
an excerpt from one of the segments from this walkthrough. So, you don't get lost in the process.

The location to the sewers is northeast of Grancel: East Block. The guy guarding the door will now let you in.
So, go straight down until you see a split path. If you go left, it'll lead to a
bunch of Scissor Hands along the roadside. The one on the right is much safer. There's a
door that leads east. We'll come back there for now. Continue to go forward until the split path merges, There,
you'll see two doors. head to the door you see on the right end of the map and
continue to move east.

On area 2, go straight until you see another intersection where you'll see a bunch of Boiled Egger O.
At the intersection where there are two wooden bridges, go to the one on your left. It should lead to the next area
the moment you enter.

On area 3, go straight until you see an intersection. Continue to move forward from the first
intersection. We'll come back at the same spot later. Anyway, you should arrive at a corridor
with two rooms. The first door nearest from the entrance will lead to a dead end. You should
find the boss at the end of the road.

=-----=
''Boss: Evil Stream x4''

It's similar to the Mouki Fight earlier in chapter I. The only difference is that it uses Grand Stream,
an all range wind art. Also, watch out for HP Absorb as well. So, counter their all-range arts with
your own using Death Scream. From there, just destroy them with your Chain Craft. Once you defeat
Evil Stream, it'll drop [[Death]].

====Elize Highway Monster: Redux====

*[[Liberl: Rolent Region]]
**Mira: 5500
**BP: 5
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: After initiating the main sidequest "Danger in the Capital"

If you are coming out from Gurune Gate via Grancel Region, it should be located right in front of you.
If you are coming from Rolent, it's at the end of the path towards Gurune Gate.

=-----=
''Boss: Vanguard x3 and Volgel EX 911 x3''

Yes, you have fought them at one point. The only thing you have to watch out for is the Gorgon Laser
from Volgel EX and Vanguard's devastating self-destruct. Be sure to use Joshua's True Black Fang
to deal with Volgel EX. Other than that, you should manage just fine with the usual tactics.
You should get [[Petrify 2]] as an item drop.

====Milch Main Road Monster: Redux====

The location of this boss is at the northeastern corner of area 2 in Milch Main Road.

''Boss: Devil Spear x3''

Devil Spear's regular attack inflicts poison. Also, it has Grand Submariner which deals damage to
all of your allies regardless of range. Finally, it uses Death Press to inflict instant death against
you. If that was not enough, it'll be accompanied with a bunch of Mars Sparrows. First, take out
the weak enemies by using Joshua's True Black Fang. Next, use Chain Crafts and S-Craft to deal
damage against the Devil Spears. Personally, I would not worry about instant death in this battle
because it's a special move, not a regular attack. If you defeat the Devil Spears, you'll get
[[Confuse 2]].

====Save the Miners====
*[[Liberl: Rolent Region]]
**Mira: 10000
**BP: 8
**Timeframe: Long
**Expires: After initiating the main sidequest "Danger in the Capital"

''HIDDEN SIDEQUEST''


As soon you relinquish one of your ZFGs to Aina, head over to Malga Mine to start the sidequest.
Talk to Landan at the elevator at the end of the path. You'll fight a bunch of Killer Crabs on
the bottom Floor. Like the first game, you will need to rescue five people inside the mine.

On the second floor, head south past the mine cart rail. You should end up at the intersection
that splits into three paths. Head east, and you'll find two miners: Heinrich and Pierre. Back
at the intersection, head west and you'll find Miner Bones. Finally, go south at the intersection
and you'll find Miner Chief Gaton. Once you defeated the Killer Crabs, it's time to go back
to the starting point and move northwest. You'll find the monster nest as well as the next boss.

=-----=
''Boss: Armored Hydra''

The Armored Hydra will do several attacks. One, it'll use Stone Toss to deal heavy earth damage
to allies within range. Next, Armored Hydra will use Grand Flash to blind your allies. Finally,
it'll use Earth Shaker to deal earth damage to allies. Be careful when the Armored Hydra's health
is below 66%, it'll begin to turn blue. During that phase, the Armored Hydra will knock away
HP as well as EP and CP for each successive attack. Watch out for Killer Crabs because they
can summon reinforcements at any moment.

This battle could be tough considering you only have one ZFG in your possession. Whoever holds
the ZFG have to be the healer of the group. Anyway, you may have to be very aggressive in this
battle. Use Joshua's True Black Fang to destroy the killer crabs. Next, use S-Crafts such as
Beat Down 2, True Barrage, or True Aural Blast to deal damage against the Armored Hydra. Also,
use Chain-Crafts to deal big damage. The whole point of this battle is to deal significant
damage at a timely matter because the longer you stall the battle, you might exhaust your
resources. Once you defeat the Armored Hydra, it'll drop [[Topaz Gem]] at the end of the battle.
=-=

After you report your investigation findings to Aina, attend the wedding at Rolent Chapel.
After that, don't forget to talk to Serra at Abend bar on the first floor. She'll give you [[Gambler Jack - Vol. 11]]
