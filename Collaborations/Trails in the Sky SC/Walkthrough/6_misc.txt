*Go northwest at the Residential Block Cradle and examine the terminal
**You'll get Data Crystal Z

*Go back to the house where you got the Resurrect Jelly and select --u--''Data Crystal''--u--
**You'll recieve a second Zemurian Ore

*Go back to the Ariselle and talk to Professor Russell and he'll make you two weapons!

====Sanktheim Gate: Before the Earthquake Investigation====
If you are going for this achievement, you need to follow this very carefully. Anton is a random NPC who appears in the most obscure places
throughout Liberl. To initiate this sidequest, you need to go to Sanktheim Gate --u--''before you investigate the Earthquake in Wolf Fort''--u--.
To find Anton, he's standing on top of the roof facing Ritter Roadway shouting his lungs off. His friend Ricky and Private Chesley should
be standing right by Anton. This is first of 16 of his dialogue.


Here are loose notes detailing what Drache belives is all Anton's appearances, which SHOULD include
all the ones that count for the achievement. (She got it while it was bugged.)

* Sankheim Gate
** ''Before earthquake investigation''
** ''During earthquake investigation'': Talk to Anton again at the same spot!
** After earthquake investigation
** After setting all three devices
** Before heading to Grancel (he says he's going there too!)

* South of Grancel Department Store:
** ''Beginning of Chapter 3''
** After finding Renne
** After speaking with both embassies and the queen. The sun must be setting.
** After Renne slips out.
** Before getting on the airship (at landing area)

* Rolent
** On the airship.
** At the landing port.
** Abend Bar, at night.
** Outside the Guild, the next day
** At the inn, after his request

* Grancel, Ch. 8
** As you pass by Grancel, he'll be in his usual spot
+
If you did it correctly, you should get the achievement. However, this will not be the last time you'll see him. He will show up in
Crossbell and Erebonia....

===Breakfast Safari===

First of all, they are not food items. They are actually pidgeons named after breakfast items.
There are a myriad of them, but we only want three of the pidgeons. Be careful, they are only
available in certain chapters. Here are the locations...

^l26|: Eggs, Golden Toast, and Bacon Location

* Erbe Royal Villa (Chapter 3)
** ''Eggs is located near the benches. Find him before the Embassy Mission.''

* Grancel: West Block (Chapter 3)
** ''Golden Toast is located in front of Grancel Chapel. You may want to walk inside and out of the chapel just to talk to one of the pidgeons.''

* Rolent: Clock Tower (Chapter 4)
** ''Bacon is located at the clock tower, third from the left. Be careful, he's only available at night.''

===Fishing===

In chapter I, be sure to talk to Lloyd inside the passenger cabin. He'll give you [[Fishing Book]] and [[Progress Rod]]. Once you arrive at City
of Ruan, you'll learn how to fish. First, choose a rod and a bait. The size of the fish depends on the bait and rod you use. For example, if you
use [[Heavy Trident Rod]], you'll catch large fishes based on the given bait. Once you chose your set-up, wait until you see the exclaimation point. Once you see the exclaimation
point, press the confirm button. Time your button presses correctly, and you'll catch a fish. Be warned that regardless the outcome of your fishing
attempt, it consumes a bait! Catch all of the fishes throughout Liberl and you'll get the achievement, ''Master Fisher''. Right below you, are the fishes
you can catch in every region!

--u--''TIP: Rather than looking for the exclaimation point above Estelle's head, HEAR the sound effect for the exclaimation
point! The moment you hear the sound, press the confirm button right away! Your chances of catching the fishes increases dramatically.''--u--

====Fishing Location====

Ruan is pretty comprehensive. The rest was tossed together by the much less
interested Drache.
