==Introduction==

=--Our goal to you, the reader...--=
|+3|
||c '' ...is to make sure that you are able to get a perfect game, meaning that you can find all of the items, explore all of the areas, uncover anything that is hidden, and see all there is to see. '' ||
|+3|
=-=

For this guide, we have decided to create an extensive FAQ/Walkthrough. The walkthrough is the main focus; it walks you through the whole game step-by-step, leading you to the locations of all of the items in the game, strategies for fighting the bosses, and even walking you through the miscellaneous extras thrown your way in the game. It will also be an extensive FAQ, which includes lists of all of the items, equipment, etc., as well as a complete bestiary.

+
+
+
+

==Starting Up==
Before even starting the game, there are a few things you should probably take a look at, just to be safe.

+
+
+

=--Note... (DLC)--=
Before starting your game, make sure to stop by the PlayStation Store to pick up a couple of freebies, or even drop some dough to start off comfortably! Make sure to at least get the three freebies to start off with some extra cash, costumes, and materials!

Oh, and don't forget to activate any DLC you received with the Limited Edition copy! (Not only do they change the costumes, but they change the characters' battle themes to those of their respective games.)

*Purchased items will be automatically installed upon boot-up of the game.
*Access the Downloadable Content section (right most header) of the Items Menu to unlock purchase.

+

'''''For the gald and Level Up DLC...'''''
*This can only be utilized once per playthrough, and cannot be reversed upon activation.
*Excess over the maximum capacity will be discarded upon use.
*The DLC pack cannot be utilized if player has already reached the maximum amount.

+

'''''For the Costume DLC...'''''
*Scroll down to the Attachments section of the Equipment Menu to equip costumes and attachments.
*Equipped attachments can be modified by pressing the START button in the Attachments section of the equipment Menu.

===Character Selection===

After setting all of your options and watching the intro movies, you'll need to choose your main character. The story is very much the same for both; there are just small differences between Jude's and Milla's viewpoints at certain points of the story, and you only see the viewpoint of the character you control; if they're separated, you'll see what the other did not. The only other major difference is that a different battle theme plays depending on your character; I believe Jude's is far better.

^sl4|

%

A kind, clever medical student who left home to attend school in the capital city. Poised to graduate, Jude is eager to find his purpose in life.

If you choose Jude, then start following along here: [[Jude's Beginning]]

^sr5|

%

A mysterious young woman accompanied by four unseen beings. She comes across as calm, collected, and wise beyond her years.

If you choose Milla, then start following along here: [[Milla's Beginning]]

==Chapter 1==

The story starts here in Fennmont! Even though there are two different characters, as stated before, a playthrough will be very similar. Notes will be included throughout the walkthrough to let you know when something character-specific needs to be made known.

=--Note...--=
Press R1 (the Navi Button) on the field to view your current objective. You can also check your current objective or read a detailed synopsis of the story from the Event List on the menu.

Also, keep in mind that you can Quick Save anywhere; you can only store one Quick Save file at a time, so be sure to use Memory Rings regularly when you come across them for multiple saves.

|* Talim Medical School |

From the start here in the '''Teaching Wing''', head west just a bit to find a row of lockers; examine the left side of them to find '''''[[Orange Gel]]'''''. Feel free to talk to the NPC's around here (though it is a bit odd not to be able to talk to everyone; just the ones with smileys above their heads; the smileys will have open mouths if you haven't talked to them yet, and close mouths if you have), then make your way east to the '''Student Services''' area. Nothing of note in here, so continue outside. You can press SQUARE to see your map and all the places you can go, but for now, you can only head north and enter the '''Reception''' area to your west.

After a quick scene, you'll receive the '''''[[Class Credit Form]]'''''. Head southwest into the '''Outpatient Wing''', then move to the end of the hall to '''Examination Room 5''' to advance the story. After the scene, go back into the Examination Room and check the desk for a '''''[[Life Bottle]]''''', then leave the building to be on our way to find Professor Haus. You can explore a bit more now -- but not by much.

Return to the '''Student Services''' building, and you should see a man sitting in a chair just to the east of the entrance. He should have a green (!) above his head; this signifies a Sub Event, so talk to him to unlock your first one: '''''[[The Cycle of Rieze Maxia]]'''''. Make sure to check out all Sub Events as you go along for more tidbits to the story, as well as shots at some Titles! From there, continue back to the '''Teaching Wing''' where you first started to find another Sub Event: '''''[[Rumors About Jude]]'''''. Once you've seen both Sub Events, head back outside to the three-way split to the east and take the southeastern path to the '''Central Plaza'''. Note the Memory Rings as you come across them; save often, and in different files, just to be safe.

First, make your way northwest and into the '''Hotel Fenntasia - Lobby'''. Ride the elevators at the end of the hall to the '''3F Hallway''' and check both rooms up here. '''Room 302''' has '''''[[100 gald]]''''' in an urn beside the door, and '''Room 303''' has '''''[[Apple Gel]]''''' in the dresser beside the bed. Return to the Plaza and move southwest next, entering the '''Samsara Trading Post 1F'''; it is here where you'll find all of the shops in one handy place! (Don't worry about buying anything though; the money will be better used later, and we'll also find/acquire these items soon enough anyway.)

Head back out to the Plaza and continue south to the '''Research District'''. Here, you'll find another Sub Event just to your west: '''''[[Spiritual Arte Failure]]'''''. Afterward, continue following along the path to the southwest for a scene with the guards. Start heading back toward the school for another scene, and you'll be inside the '''Laforte Research Center - Sewer Tunnel 1'''.

=--Note...--=
Even though the next section is titled 'Milla's Beginning', continue reading anyway; if you're playing as Jude, this section will still apply to you, as this is where the two stories merge. From here on out, anything Jude or Milla specific will be pointed out.

=--Note...--=
# As you explore dungeons and towns throughout the game, you will come across sparkling/twinkling points, as well of bags of loot. These things will give you a random item/material/gald/etc., and will also appear somewhat randomly; sometimes they appear, sometimes they do not. Because of the randomness of these items, they will not be covered in the walkthrough; just be sure to keep an eye out for them as you explore.
# Obsessed with skits? Don't use any Gels till you get to Xian Du. Recommended for NG+ only.

In the northernmost part of the "H" hallway you're in is a chest containing '''''[[Cape]]''''', so be sure to grab it before proceeding to '''Sewer Tunnel 2'''. In this area, you will find your first battle; you can skip the tutorial if you like, which is a blessing to any Tales veteran; otherwise, pay close attention to learn the basics. After the battle, carry on to the next Sewer Tunnel (3 for Milla, 4 for Jude.) At the end of the area, you'll have another fight and tutorial. Afterward, climb the nearby ladder to '''Sector 2'''.

|* Sector 2 |

Near the door in the easternmost corner is a chest containing '''''[[Orange Gel]] x2'''''. From there, climb the stairs to the elevated central corridor and continue northwest; in the octagon-shaped structure up the stairs is a chest full of '''''[[Apple Gel]] x3'''''. Use the nearby Memory Ring, then climb the smaller stairs beside the Memory Ring itself. Continue through the northern door for a scene and your first boss battle.

''Part 1:'' This part is for Jude only, leading to it being a two part battle. This first battle you're meant to lose, so go ahead and let her take you out (unless you want a lengthy, meaningless challenge.) The second part of the battle is fought by both regardless of who you're controlling.

''Part 2:'' Milla is super overpowered. Unless you're on a harder difficulty, even if Red staggers you a lot, there shouldn't be a problem mopping the floor with her. If you're not already controlling her, just use L1 and her directional button to take control of her, then spam Sylph or Undine using LEFT STICK + UP (or + RIGHT) to wipe her out. Hopefully you're quick enough and Jude wins some EXP as well.

Leave the room for another tutorial about Lilium Orbs. Feel free to develop the grid however you like, as it's pretty flexible! A Backdated Future pretty much leans toward building the STR and HP to begin with, but stays within the beginning levels of the grid to keep them balanced as he goes. Once he get the first two levels done, he goes outward to the third level, then the fourth and so on. You can also Auto-Level by pressing SELECT; if you don't want to put much thought into it and worry about other aspects of the game, then go ahead and do this. Drache took this lazy approach and she's a happier person for it. :D Do you want to be a happy person?

When you regain control, open the chest to the south for a '''''[[Life Bottle]]'''''. Enter the room '''Laboratory 06''' to claim a '''''[[Chamomile]]''''' up the ladder. Leave, head downstairs and toward the door at the northwest end of the room to reach '''Sector 3'''.

|* Sector 3 |

The far western corner near the octagon-shaped platform has a chest containing '''''[[400 gald]]''''' end. Do not enter the nearest door to the east yet; you will miss some items. Instead, go up the stairs to the central corridor, then continue up the smaller set that lead up to the next level to the southeast. Enter '''Laboratory 12''' and climb the ladder inside for a chest containing '''''[[500 gald]]'''''. To the far northeast, open the two chests to the northeast for '''''[[Apple Gel]] x2''''' and '''''[[Orange Gel]]'''''. Now, head for the first door you ignored back on the ground floor along the southeastern wall, '''Laboratory 04''' for a scene...

And finally, the game's opening! Progress! Milla has now been nerfed, but we're sure you figured that out. :) Her skills are also vastly different.

|* Fennmont |

=--Note...--=
If you're playing as Milla, you'll acquire the '''''[[Kresnik Key]]''''' automatically.
=-=

There's nothing to do here after the battle, so continue to the next screen. The red dots on the map are enemies you can fight, and green ones are people you can talk to, so feel free to fight/chat. When you're ready, you need to go to the Seahaven, so head north to the '''Talim Medical School'''. As Jude suggested, head toward the eastern exit to reach '''Fennmont Seahaven'''. Watch the series of events, and you'll eventually regain control in the Aladhi Seahaven.

You are introduced to Sub Events as you arrive; anyone with a green (!) icon will have something for you to do (if you're playing as Jude, you've already done a few.) Right in front of you is one such person; talk to her to proceed the story. (Rather than actually unlocking a Sub Event, this continues the main event.) Feel free to check out the shops while you're here as well, if you'd like to upgrade your equipment.

=--Note...--=
To unlock more items in the shops, you need to increase your shop level. This normally rises along with just shopping, but you can also either contribute gald or donate materials to the shops to earn points towards higher levels in a quicker fashion. Some shops will give you a bonus depending on the type of materials you donate to them. The higher the shop level, the better quality goods you can buy, and the cheaper the items will get.

For donating to increase the level, if you plan to donate materials, then it's probably best to wait until you've completed the Sub Events in the area, just in case you are asked for a material that may not come by very easily. This next area is handled quite easily with your default equipment, so you may want to wait until your return.
=-=

Once you're ready, head northeast to the '''Aladhi Trail'''.

^l10|

|* Aladhi Trail - South Region |

You'll be introduced to Linking upon arrival. When you regain control, make your way north and east for a forced skit ('''''[[There's a Town Around Here]]'''''). Continue hugging the eastern wall for a chest containing '''''[[Life Bottle]]'''''. Since you can't continue in this direction, follow the northern wall back west. By the two trees southwest of there is a chest containing '''''[[Apple Gel]]'''''. From there, continue northwest and look for a chest in an alcove to the northeast for '''''[[600 gald]]'''''. Continue northwest to the next area.

|* Aladhi Trail - West Branch |

Follow along the northern wall, and you'll reach a chest containing '''''[[Saffron]]''''' in the shadow of trees at the western end of this section. Make your way back east, then as the path narrows to the south, look for a chest along the eastern wall next to a tree for '''''[[Weird Fragment]] x4'''''. Once you have that, continue along the southern path until you reach a dead-end with the monsters we were looking for. Don't worry; it's just another tutorial battle; this one is for Over Limit.

Afterward, check the chest directly ahead of you for some '''''[[Boots]]'''''; be sure to equip them on someone. When you're ready, head back to the '''Seahaven'''.

# Now that you can use Auto Items... don't turn them off! It can definitely be annoying to have your Apple Gels get eaten, but there is a trophy attached to 400 auto item uses.
# Make sure that your AI allies activate their skills (Jude's Restore, Milla's Bind, Alvin's Breaker) 150 times for a series of trophies. This one can take a while, so make sure to link with everyone from time to time.
# As the player, use each character's special skills (Snap Pivot, Spirit Shift, Charge) 150 times for even more trophies.
# For pretty much any trophy you can get, there is a title that demands a higher number. There are no trophies attached to getting all titles, so don't feel obligated to, for instance, Snap Pivot 450 times.
# Once you can buy food, never fight without it again. You need 800 encounters and you need to consume food 800 times, both for trophies.
# Shop levels max out at 100. Yep, that's another trophy.

Head back and talk to the client for an '''''[[Item Sphere]]''''' and '''''[[2000 gald]]'''''. Head to the inn; after the scene, you'll finally be able to buy from the Food Vendor. Food lasts several battles, at least, so you don't need to totally break the bank to buy a bunch (...though you can only have one of each food item). Do increase the shop levels often so you can get more items and discounts.

Head to the town's exit to get Alvin back. Now it's time for more sub events! Right behind you to the southwest are two clients for the Sub Events [[The Legendary Flavor]] and [[The Monster Lies]]. A third client, located at the northern tip of the area, is attached to [[Fruit Seller]]. Please click the links if you need help with those events. Remember to return to clients after you've killed monsters to reap your rewards. (You have to proceed before getting a Porange, so don't worry about the fruit yet for the last Sub Event.) Just head to the trail.

|* Aladhi Trail - South Region |

The path to the northeast is clear now, so unless you want to bash in monster skulls, proceed that way to the next area.

|* Aladhi Trail - North Region |

As you come to the split path just to the north, look just to the left of the large rock formation for a chest with '''''[[Wood Chunk]] x10'''''. From there, head all the way east for a chest containing '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5''''', then continue north along the eastern wall to find another chest, this one with '''''[[Apple Gel]] x2'''''. After exploring the rest of the area for fights and extra random treasures, make your way to the far north to arrive in the next town, '''Hamil'''.

=--Note...--=
The random junk you find in drawers and nightstands? Yeah, that counts as a treasure chest by the in-game counter, and thus they count toward a trophy for opening 300 chests.
=-=

Head to the southwest corner of the area for a scene introducing you to Aifread's Treasures, and you get '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''. Henceforth, almost every new area will have two of his treasures for you to find, to a total of 61; 50 of those are needed for a trophy. You can get a '''''[[Napple]]''''' and '''''[[Wild Bird Egg]] x3''''' in the nearby residence on the northwestern side of town... Thief. Enter the Mayor's house and check the counter/dresser on the eastern side of the house (near the stairs and under a window) for '''''[[300 gald]]'''''. Head upstairs and check the bed in Room 2 for an '''''[[Apple Gel]]''''', and the nightstand in Room 1 for '''''[[Life Bottle]]'''''.

Now go ahead and talk to the Mayor to rest for the night. Afterward, head to the western side of town and toward the Galia Trail to meet Elize, then hit the trail.

|* Galia Trail - East Region |

^l12|

To the southwest of where you start at the base of a tree is '''''[[900 gald]]'''''. Follow the path through the bottleneck and look at the circle of trees at the southernmost tip of the area. Check the south side of one of the trees for your first Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Bandage]]'''''. Follow the wall west as it goes north to claim a '''''[[Life Bottle]]''''', then head to the northern wall and follow it for '''''[[Orange Gel]] x2'''''. Head to the '''West Region'''.

|* Galia Trail - West Region |

Follow the northern wall to a '''''[[Pudding Cake (Small)]]''''', then head to the southeast corner for a '''''[[Stun Bracelet]]'''''. From there, head north along the eastern wall and look at the second rock along the way for Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[2000 gald]]'''''. Near the end of the path is an '''''[[Orange Gel]]'''''. Continue to the next area.

|* East Beach |

Check out the south side of the body of water for '''''[[Meat Sauce Pasta (Small)]]''''', then scale the first cliff to the southwest and head south for '''''[[700 gald]]'''''. Continue up the next cliff and follow the oval all the way around for '''''[[Jasmine]]'''''. Now drop into the western area to proceed.

|* Central Area |

Head to the southern cave for a '''''[[Melange Gel]]''''', and ignore the cliffs for now. Go through the northwestern mini-tunnel to the other side of the rock wall. Turn around; on the northern end of the rock wall is one of Aifread's Treasures, '''''[[Pet Dragon]]'''''. The only other thing in this area is a chest to the west containing a '''''[[Bronze Helm]]'''''. Be sure to equip it!

Now go back to the beginning of the area and climb the cliffs near the cave; there is a chest to the west containing '''''[[Heal Bangle]]'''''. Jump down the southeastern cliffs to reach ground level again. From the bottom, turn north to find a chest in the wall's cavity -- it has '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x6'''''. Carry on to the next area... for a nice surprise.

This boss comes attached to a tutorial about linked artes. You might as well try chaining on this boss, as he isn't particularly difficult at the beginning. His movements start slow enough that you can tell, most of the time, when to guard. He does have two attacks he'll start spamming that both hit a wide circular range; you'd better run if he starts it. He'll thrust his antennas into the ground when he activates either of them; the difference between them is that one attack follows its target (probably you), and the other is short range.

To deal some decent damage, control Milla and use her Fireball in conjunction with either Alvin's Tiger Blade to land Hell Pyre, or Jude's Soaring Vortex for Aerial Fire. (If you have Jude's Steel and Milla's Flame Ring, then that does even more damage, though it's a bit harder to get Jude to cooperate.) Link with Alvin on occasion when he's needed to break the Demon's guard, and use Jude for normal attacks when Milla's TP runs low and he's not needed for healing. Depending on the difficulty, if you don't like playing healer, it's worth it to take control of Milla, since you'll likely be healing more often than not.

One of the cute things about ailments in this game is that if your linked partner gets one, you get one too. So watch out for weak. Oh, and don't be a dummy like Drache was. Upgrade your equipment. ;)

Carry on up the nearby cliff to the next area.

|* West Beach |

Go up the cliff, then drop down the southern side for a '''''[[Life Bottle]]'''''. Afterward, turn around and claim Aifread's Treasure to the west, a '''''[[Guardian Emblem]]''''', from the wall. Go up the cliff again, then down the cliffs to the west for a scene.

The game takes you to the Memory Ring. Instead of progressing, head backward and take the northern trail to find '''''[[Apple Gel]] x3'''''. Now, head to the next town.

=-=

Check out the piggies. They're actually rappigs. :) Secondly, don't go to Xagut Floodmeadow unless you want to die. The enemies are high enough level to hand your ass to you in one hit.

Near the exit you wind up by is a guy with a request -- [[Incoming Monster]], then go inside the nearby house (Ivar's House) and pilfer '''''[[500 gald]]'''''. The next building, Residence 3, has an '''''[[Apple Gel]]'''''. Head across the northern bridge going east to get '''''[[Temporal Wind Stone]]''''' at the altar, then take the request, [[Offerings for Milla]], from the person standing next to it. Further east, Residence 2 has a '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]''''' inside.

The second altar is just south of here, containing '''''[[Temporal Earth Stone]]'''''. Next to the item shop is an old guy you can talk to for [[The Myth of Maxwell]] sub-event. Near the exit to the east is the request, [[Something Tasty]]. You should be able to fulfill this request immediately, assuming you got the Napple in Hamil. Check inside Residence 1 for '''''[[Sandwich (Small)]]'''''. Check out the squiggly path on the south end of the map; jump down from the bridge to the rocks on the river and check the altar for '''''[[Temporal Water Stone]]'''''. Then, west of the bridge, is the final altar and '''''[[Temporal Fire Stone]]'''''.

With that in hand, off to the '''Nia Khera Spiritway''' to the west.

Remember to get an [[Insect Husk]] for [[Offerings for Milla]]. You can either find them as loot or get them from the evil Butterflies.

Follow the north wall to a chest containing '''''[[Panacea Bottle]]'''''. On the west wall, near the southern cliff, is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''. Up that cliff are the enemies from  [[Incoming Monster]]. Hidden on the south side of the rock nearby is one of Aifread's Treasures, '''''[[Framed Glasses]]'''''. At the central eastern tip of the area is '''''[[800 gald]]'''''. From there, head west to the '''Southwest Region'''.

|* Southwest Region |

^sr16|

Take the south path; on the first step up and to the north is '''''[[Yakisoba Noodles (Small)]]'''''. Follow along the central wall; on it, behind a group of three trees, is  Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''. Head up the southwest cliff for '''''[[Leather Cape]]''''', then hug the northernmost wall and head east to find '''''[[Sage]]'''''. Now continue to '''Milla's Shrine''' for a few scenes. Afterward, return to Nia Khera.

** Sapstrath Seahaven: '''''[[(The Softest Beds in Town)]]''''', '''''[[(The Suspicious Sailor)]]'''''
+

Be sure to return to the two clients, since you should have completed both sub events now. One should be right at the entrance, and the other is by the altar at the north. Go south to the Assembly Hall (where the Inn is) to find the mayor. Now, leave Nia Khera to the east and head back in the direction of Hamil.

On the way, you get a '''''[[World Map]]'''''. Hehe... Instant warping with R3 :D So off to Hamil!

|* Hamil |

''As Jude...'' Enter the second area to a scene about Elize, then return to the western area and follow her into the shed and its cellar for another scene.

''As Milla...'' Go to the mayor's and talk to her for a scene.

Once you regain control, before leaving Hamil, check the brown crate in the cellar of the shed for a '''''[[Porange]]'''''. (Also rest in the bed here, if you need to recover.) Once you have that, make your way back to the Aladhi Seahaven.

|* Aladhi Seahaven |

Since you got a Porange, talk to the guy at the north part of town to complete [[Fruit Seller]]. There's nothing to do here except try to catch a boat at the port. You'll have to go to Sapstrath Seahaven.

|* Sapstrath Seahaven |

''Sidequests galore!''
** Approach the bulletin board for some wanted posters, part of [[The Message]]. (Never knew you had it in you, Jude!)
** A sailor down the stairs to the northwest gives the request [[Special Delivery to the Inn]] and a '''''[[Package Addressed to Inn]]'''''.
** Approach the sailor toward the southeast end of town for an automatic scene and sub event, [[Anticipated Reunion]].
** At the southeastern corner of town is another sub event, [[The Femme Fatale]].
** Rest at the inn for a scene and the first part of [[Those Who Act in Shadow]].
** Approach the exit to be introduced to the Devil's Arms and [[The Devil's Beasts]].

Make note that the first seven enemies above are right here in the Highroad; we'll be encountering them later as well, so feel free to skip them for now.

Get close to the carts to the west for a scene. That north cliff is going to troll you for a little while, so there's not much you can do there just yet. Time to take the scenic route through Deepwood, so take the southern cliff up to a '''''[[Soda Rice (Small)]]''''' and the next area.

|* Sapstrath Deepwood - Northeast Region |

Be sure to find a [[Poison Stinger]] here for [[The Femme Fatale]]. Also, you may find a [[Bacura]] here. It's a strong boss type enemy worth a lot of experience, but a bit much for this point. Be careful.

Crawl through the passage get ambushed... and the cutie finally joins!

Now that you have four active party members, you can put two of them to work. The titles along the lines of '''Jude <3 Milla''' and '''Milla <3 Elize''' require 30 minutes of linked time. So set the strategies of all characters to "Link Often", and make sure you're always linked yourself. This isn't worth anything other than a series of titles, so if you aren't a super OCD completionist, you don't have to worry about it.
=-=

Continue up the cliff for two paths. Crawl through the path to the south for '''''[[1500 gald]]''''' in a chest, then continue west to the '''North Region'''. There's a small mob as part of [[The Amazing Bounty Hunter]], so take them out, then claim the chest containing '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x6''''' afterward.

With that diversion out of the way, head back to the fork at the '''Northeast Region''' and drop down the western path. Along the way is '''''[[Orange Gel]] x2''''' and '''''[[Poison Ward]]''''', so grab them before moving on to the '''North Region'''.

|* North Region |

Jump down for a scene. Avoid those shrooms in the future, as they damage you. Crawl through the passage on the north side and climb the cliffs for '''''[[Mabo Curry (Small)]]'''''. Climbing the western cliff from here gets you Aifread's treasure, '''''[[Black Bunny Ears]]'''''. Jumping back down the next two cliffs to the east lets you reach the place you started at. There are, again, two exits; ignore the ivy that takes you higher and continue south to the '''South Region'''.

|* South Region |

Cross the river and climb the nearby vines to the south for '''''[[Orange Gel]] x2'''''. Grab the'''''[[Verbena]]''''' in the eastern section of the area, then climb the nearby vines all the way up for '''''[[Apple Gel]] x2''''', and '''''[[Hard Coat]]'''''.

Head back to the '''North Region''', and take the path you skipped: climb up the vines, grab the '''''[[Mysterious Liquid]] x6''''' to the east, then exit west.

|* Southwest Region |

Right next to you is '''''[[Supple Ivy]] x9''''', and at the northern tip of the area is '''''[[Holy Bottle]]'''''. Grab those, then continue southeast to another portion of the '''South Region'''.

|* South Region |

Head down the path toward the Memory Ring for '''''[[Life Bottle]]'''''.

Be sure to save before carrying on. With a strong boss forthcoming, it may be smart to use a food to increase your DEF (like the Yakisoba Noodles) as well. When you're ready, continue to the next area to come across a rather giant blockade.

He comes with two small fry. Be sure to get rid of them quickly so the whole party is focused on the big guy. If Jiao is chasing you, by all means ignore them. He hits like a truck. He's just slow enough to guard when he brings his hammer down to blast the area around him. You'll want to keep Elize's TP up so she can heal.

Definitely control Milla in this fight, as Jude's Soaring Vortex takes too long and keeps you open for damage. Link with him though, as tossing in an extra Final Gale and / or Aerial Fire definitely helps. Do your best to hit him with Milla's wind attacks, as they may actually stagger him. His attacks get heavier as you whittle down his HP, and they tend to either stun or knock you down. He will also summon a [[Hawk]] at some point, as well as another [[Sylvan Wolf]] or two. At this point, it's best to keep Jiao's attention yourself; otherwise he'll beat up the *rest* of your party.

In the event you have access to Fairy Circle (Milla/Elize), don't cast it too close to him unless you want to get stunned after casting. Hammer Rain is pretty good, though.

One level below you, behind a small rock northwest from the entrance is '''''[[Panacea Bottle]] x2'''''. Directly south of the next Memory Ring to the northwest is a '''''[[Holy Bottle]]'''''. Climb up the vine on the northern cliff, claim a '''''[[Melange Gel]]''''', then take the nearby exit to the north.

|* North Branch |

Drop down from the cliff; by the trees to the south is '''''[[1500 gald]]'''''. Climb the nearest eastern vines; to the south is a is a cavity in the wall you can crawl into for an '''''[[Elixir]]'''''. A second cavity is located north along the same wall; it contains '''''[[Orange Gel]]'''''. Jump down the cliff, now.

Search along the north wall for another cavity, leading to '''''[[Basil]]'''''. Southwest from it, just beneath the northwest cliff, is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''. Climb up the vines here; within the trees to the northwest is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]''''', and the cavity to the south holds a '''''[[Warrior Emblem]]'''''.

You're done here. You can now go back to the previous area and go to town, the western exit that we passed earlier. To Sharilton!

Scene as you enter. Remember to keep a [[Poison Stinger]] around if you donate materials to the shops. On the western wall near the shops is the [[Jet Black Feather Trading Post]] for the [[Jet Black Feathers]] sub event. Talk to the little girl by the item shop for the second part of [[Anticipated Reunion]].

Item obsessed? The NPC on the cart at the south part of the area sells '''''[[Ice Pop]]'''''. You have to use those items to get both a '''''[[Win Stick]]''''' and a '''''[[Lose Stick]]'''''.

As you enter the '''Central Plaza''' to the southwest, there's another request waiting for you by the entrance, [[The Sad Salesman]], and across from the weapon shop is the first part of [[The Runaways]]. Near the northwest exit are a group of three attached to an automatic scene and [[The Clouds of Battle Begin to Stir]]. Go to the inn to the south of them and talk to the girl near the fireplace to finish off [[Special Delivery to the Inn]].

At '''Lord's Manor Gates''' to the far south, you'll come to a scene. You'll be allowed to speak to Rowen or Jude/Milla. The western room up the stairs has a book to read, and you can get a '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]''''' by the yellow lamp behind Elize and Driselle. Try to leave after talking to everyone for a scene.

After you leave, talk to the kid to the north and east for a '''''[[Lucky Charm]]''''' and [[Travel Protection]]. Then talk to the twins on the other side of the area for [[Pretty and Pink]]. Proceed back north to the plaza to find Alvin, that tattlejerk... Rowen is awesome... and he joins.

Before moving on in the story, go back to the '''Sapstrath Highroad - Southwest Region''' from Sharilton, then go north and up the vines to the '''North Branch''' and climb up the cliff to the northwest to fight a mob as part of [[The Sad Salesman]].

Now warp to '''Sapstrath Deepwood - SW Entrance'''. On the wall just north the entrance is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Elixir]] x2'''''. Yep, the game is a jerk. You should have 10 of Aifread's Treasures now, to give you the title of '''Pirate Recruit'''.

Next is '''Sapstrath Seahaven'''. Talk to the guy right at the entrance to complete [[The Amazing Bounty Hunter]]. You should also earn '''Sub Event Starter''' for completing 10 sub events. Give the lady at the northern end of town a Poison Stinger to finish [[The Femme Fatale]].

At '''Aladhi Seahaven''', head south from the entrance to find a guy selling Teepos, as part of [[Anticipated Reunion]]. Near the ships is the guy you deliver the Lucky Charm to, ending [[Travel Protection]].

In '''Nia Khera''', check out the rappigs just to the west of the peddler for... uh, wait, one of them is a piggit? Bunny pink? Pig pink? ;_; Anyway, this is for [[Rappig, Rappig]]. Talk to Ivar near the northwest exit for [[Ivar the Shaman]].

In '''Hamil''', go to the shed's basement where Elize was kept for [[A Life in Shackles]]. Then head to the Eastern District for [[The People of Hamil]].

Finally, return to entrance of the '''Sharilton - Central Plaza''' to finish [[The Sad Salesman]]. That's it for odds and ends, so shop around if you like, but when you're ready, let's continue the story by exiting Sharilton to the far southwest to go to the Culmar Trail.

New tutorial battle right as you enter. Take the western path after the first loop; it's difficult to see, but before hitting the next loop, the south wall has a hole to crawl into. It leads to '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''. Continue west to nearby loop and check behind the central pillar for Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Black Dog's Tail]]'''''. Head back to the main road; the next loop in the trail to the southwest has another hole on the west side. Here, you get '''''[[Orange Soup (Small)]]'''''. The southeast tip of the area also has a hole there, leading to '''''[[Syrup Bottle]] x3'''''. On the tree just outside the hole is a second Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[4000 gald]]'''''.

Go ahead and make your way to the far southwest corner to the Gorge for a scene. And do take note that Milla is hiding the key around her bazongas. O_O

You can find [[Peachberry Blossoms]] in the Gathering Points here for [[Pretty and Pink]].

Back outside of the cavern, check just to the south to find a short ledge / cliff with a yellow chest; hop up there and open it for a '''''[[Seal Ward]]'''''. Jump down, then head to the northwestern cliffs. After you've climbed two vines (you'll see a tree growing off the edge of the platform), go to the southeastern edge of the cliff and jump down for '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x7'''''. Go back up the vines, then up the cliff next to you. Follow the path around to the west and north to '''''[[Panacea Bottle]] x2'''''. Afterward, head to the '''South Region'''.

|* South Region |

The nearby downward path to the west leads to '''''[[Potato Salad (Small)]]'''''. Continue up the slope, and when you reach the vines leading up, drop off the edge to the west, and you'll find Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Headband]]'''''. You can see it better from the level below. Now jump down the ledge from the east side of the vines to find a '''''[[Wind Cape]]''''', then jump to the lowest level. In the eastern tip down there is '''''[[Orange Gel]] x2'''''. Climb the vines on the pillar near there to wind up right next to the first chest of the area, then go up to the top, climbing the vines we skipped over, for a '''''[[Silver Hat]]'''''. Jump down the cliffs to the west and north to reach the '''Northwest Region'''.

|* Northwest Region |

If you want to check out the entire area below for materials, jump down from the EAST side and make your way to the first chest from there. If you don't care, jump down the western vines twice to for '''''[[Lavender]]'''''. Either way, once you have the Lavender, climb back up to the level you started on, then take the western path for a '''''[[Pure White Puffball]] x5''''' one level down. Up the vines and immediately to your right will be Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Elixir]] x2'''''. Further along will be a '''''[[Fancy Ribbon]]''''', and at the top level to the south of the last chest is '''''[[3000 gald]]'''''. Once you have all that, continue east to the '''Northeast Region'''.

|* Northeast Region |

There's a boulder to the northeast you can push down to create a shortcut. You can head back to any town now if you wish; Drache did, as she got her butt handed to her just ahead... and it was 100% effective! (Seriously though; if you didn't get any Seal Wards before, now's a good time to make sure you have them for your active party. You'll definitely need them in the upcoming battle.)

Follow the path all the way around to the south side for a '''''[[Life Bottle]]''''', then proceed up the vines on the center platform to the next level for a scene.

Consider using Syrup Bottles; they have limited times, but prevent ailments. This guy will inflict a bunch of 'em with mist attacks -- Arteseal, Poison, and Skillseal. He also has wide range, hard hitting attacks (one stuns!), so try to keep him away from Elize if you have her out. Consider giving her (or everyone, depending on how many you have) the Seal Ward so she can keep healing and using artes, and someone else should have the Stun Bracelet on (likely Jude, so he's always dealing damage). He can cast both a bell attack (it can confuse, but this is a larger problem on higher difficulties) or a wind attack, so be sure to stay on him and consider linking to Rowen when you see it coming.

Your best bet is using Igneous Crush (Jude's Cerberus Strike / Milla's & Rowen's Rock Trine) and chaining from there if you're lucky, getting as many in as you can per set of Linked Artes. While it is weak to Earth, Rock Trine on its own will miss most of the time, making it practically useless. You can also spam Fireball (with extra Fireballs) with Rowen from a distance, if you're having trouble.

If you have access to Recovery Heal (Jude's Recovery Ring / Elize's Recover), that would be quite lovely to use this battle, as it acts like a massive Syrup Bottle AND Panacea Bottle. Pixie Heal (Jude's Healer / Elize's Pixie Heal) also works quite nicely for mass HP recovery.

Those boots you got increase your running speed. There are two chests to the northeast and east, before you head out. They contain '''''[[Melange Gel]] x3''''' and '''''[[5000 gald]]'''''. Now warp to Sharilton.

The skit above is a hint to the next place you should be heading. Stop by the two twins for the next part of [[Pretty and Pink]], if you have the Peachberry Blossom they asked for. Of course, this sidequest isn't over. Continue to the ''Central Plaza'' and head straight north for a view of the windmill, then talk to the man here to start [[The Shape of Our World]], where you'll obtain the '''''[[Spirit Clime Examination Arte]]'''''.

Teleport to the '''Bermia Gorge'''. Head inside the cavern directly in front of you for [[Mystery of the Gorge]], then head back out and climb to the tip-top of the dungeon for the [[The Shape of Our World]] sub-event. Afterward, return to the client in '''Sharilton'''.

You can now traverse the entirety of '''Sapstrath Highroad - Northeast Region'''. On the wall near the southwest exit is a hole leading to '''''[[2000 gald]]'''''. Near a tree by the east of there is a '''''[[Life Bottle]]'''''. Climb up the north cliff; the boulder toward the west end of the wall has Aifread's Treasure on the other side, '''''[[Black Dog Ears]]''''', and there is also a chest up here containing '''''[[Hard Scale]] x7'''''.

If you're on Milla's path, see [[Talys Highroad (Jude)]] right now. It's an optional area for Milla, and the levels can be helpful.

With that diversion out of the way, go ahead and rest at the Lord's Manor, then send Rowen.

* As Milla, you'll be forced north to go shopping... then a battle that you can't win. You'll automatically get '''''[[Milla's Pendant]]'''''. For her next section, click [[Fort Gandala (Milla)]].
* As Jude, you'll have to run to the Central Plaza, then to the Manor. Afterward, before leaving to Talys Highroad, go to the Central Plaza to and look for a group of two people to see [[Military Secrets]].

You may find a Bacura here. Probably still a bad time to attempt fighting it.

Just north of the entrance is a '''''[[Life Bottle]]''''', and continue following the eastern wall as it goes north, then west. Keep an eye out for a hole; crawl through it for an '''''[[Hourglass]]'''''. Head for the southern cliff, now; behind a rock along the wall is Aifread's Treasure,  '''''[[Sly Glasses]]'''''. Further west along the wall is a cavity to crawl in for '''''[[3000 gald]]'''''. Once you have that, hop back down and take the northwestern exit.

|* West Region |

Climb the central cliff for '''''[[Fine Down]] x8'''''. To the northeast of it, below the east cliff, is '''''[[Tofu Cracker (Small)]]'''''. Head up the eastern cliff and make your way to the northern wall for a hole hiding an '''''[[All-Divide]]'''''. Now, don't go to the Fort just yet; climb up the cliff to the southwest to the... southwest branch.

|* Southwest Branch |

By the pillar's east side is '''''[[Rosemary]]'''''. On the wall by the southeast corner, near a cactus, is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''. In the wall a little southeast of there is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x7'''''. Finally, just on the southwest side of the pond here are a couple of trees with a chest between them; it has '''''[[Broken Fang]] x10'''''. With that done, return to the West Region and continue west to Fort Gandala.

You'll automatically receive the '''''[[Elevator Key]]''''' after the scene. Also, make note that a lot of exits are blocked at the moment, but will appear on the map.

Right next to where you start is '''''[[Melange Gel]] x2'''''. Head all the way to the other side of the area; in front of the southwest statue is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[4000 gald]]'''''. Behind one of the carriages is '''''[[Holy Bottle]] x2'''''. Take the north door from here. On the northern railing, all the way to the west, is '''''[[French Toast (Small)]]''''', then take the elevator to B1. Grab the '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5''''' along the wall to the northeast, then head in the room for an '''''[[All-Divide]]'''''.

On 3F, grab '''''[[Life Bottle]] x2''''' next to the east exit, and the '''''[[Silver Helm]]''''' on the northwest end of the area. Enter the west room and push the block to make a path up. At the bottom, take the northwest lift to find another block. Move it below for '''''[[1500 gald]]''''' and '''''[[Pure White Puffball]] x5''''' Crawl in the hole by the treasures and make your way to the lift in there, then crawl through the hole on the second floor for a fight and the '''''[[Control Room Key]]'''''. Go ahead and unlock the door, but you need to crawl back through the hole.

Take the block down the lift and make a path to '''''[[Fine Boots]]''''', then push it to the north end of the room to make a path to the second hole. In there, make a path to the '''''[[Splint Mail]]''''', then push the block to the southeast wall to get '''''[[5000 gald]]'''''. On 2F, grab the '''''[[Blue Chamomile]]''''' by the west exit. Exit through the westernmost door on 1F to get to the carriages, and go straight ahead to the next door to find your destination... and a fight against mooks. There's only one way to go, and you get to see the results of Milla's insanity.

And Elize is deadweight. Lovely. Check the sink in the cell for '''''[[Orange Gel]] x2'''''. At the southern end of the next room is '''''[[Sandwich (Medium)]]'''''. Head into '''Warehouse 02''' for a fight and '''''[[Control Room Key]]'''''. Go up to 3F from that room, grab the box, push it to the lift, then make a way up to the chest below. You get '''''[[Gold Dust]] x10'''''. Crawl through the hole, then take the next lift at the far end of the room. There's another hole to crawl through up there, amidst the boxes, for '''''[[2500 gald]]''''' and '''''[[Cat Hairband]]'''''. Back to the pushable box; down the lift and claim your '''''[[Melange Gel]] x2'''''. Back through the hole, head up the lift and leave the room.

Outside, across the small bridge is '''''[[Holy Bottle]] x2'''''. Consider using them if the enemies have roughed you up too much. Enter '''Warehouse 04''' for another encounter. You get '''''[[Elevator Key]]''''' In this room, there is a box you can push out of the way for '''''[[Gold Dust]] x10'''''. Leave the room, and head for the elevator in the middle of the area.

At '''B1''', there is a chest containing '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5''''', then head in the door. Pull the box on the lift, go up, and push it to the north to get '''''[[Fine Boots]]''''', then push it to get up the south cliff for '''''[[Pure White Puffball]] x5'''''. Push the box up there on top of your other one, and drag 'em both down the lift, then make a path to the '''''[[Long Coat]]''''' and '''''[[5000 gald]]'''''. Take the lift up, and leave. Right next to the door is '''''[[Lemon Gel]] x2'''''. Go into the final room for one  hell of a scene.

Turn right around and go to the Lord's Manor. Talk to Elize for [[Teepo: Back in Action]]. Enter the west room and talk to Driselle for [[Cline and Driselle]]. Buy any healing items you need now.

Now take the ''Sapstrath Highroad'' to ''Sapstrath Seahaven''. You'll encounter scenes along the way, and if you're on Jude's side, you'll get '''''[[Milla's Pendant]]'''''. There's also a fight with a boar; if you're used to Milla, be sure to practice against it and some of the other enemies around. Continue to the Seahaven...

If you're used to Milla (Drache was!), this is really awkward, but can be done. Aqua Sweep will knock him down and give you time to recover, just make sure to run away from him first. His combos are pretty damaging, and the main problem to anyone not used to Jude is healing. Don't use Healer; Ivar's too fast for that. He'll also Seal your artes, get behind you, and break your guard. Seal Ward isn't a bad item! Keep dodging his combos, and try to free run and bait him into attacking air. He will attack faster than you; don't try to out speed him. Demon Fist can be used from a distance, but don't overdo it.

Jude's Snap Pivot, activated by backstepping away from an enemy's attack, is actually quite a nice ability as it gets him behind the enemy. It makes things a looooot easier. If you don't have it mastered, the battle is simple enough that it can be done without, but it will be harder.

If the enemies kick your butt, you can try to avoid them or come back later. They're kind of tough, at least with two party members.

Climb up the cliff and search the wall for a cavity containing '''''[[Thief's Cape]]'''''. Down the north side of the cliff; on a tree is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Half-frame Glasses]]'''''. By a rock to the east is another chest containing '''''[[Lemon Gel]]'''''. Near the northeast exit is '''''[[Chocolate Parfait (Small)]]'''''. Proceed to the '''Northeast Branch'''.

Between a few trees before the path turns north, there is a chest containing '''''[[Herb]] x10'''''. On a tree just to the east of it is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''. Continue along till you hit a cliff; on the eastern edge of it is a chest containing '''''[[Blue Saffron]]'''''. Finally, by the body of water is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''. Don't explore the mine you wind up next to unless you want to die... but go ahead and enter through that small hole to create a world map shortcut. Go to '''Felgana Mine''', as you're supposed to.

* Materials in Rocks
** Block of Quartz
** Mud Rock
** Rock Salt
** Ancient Fossilized Insect

The rocks you can mine here may yield a Block of Quartz, so be sure to get one for [[Heavy Metal Collector]]. Just mine every rock you see; they don't always appear, except the ones covering holes.

The path immediately to the north of the exit has a '''''[[Lemon Gel]]''''' at the end. Carry along for a scene... and the ability to break rocks. There's only one point to mine at: the southern part of the room, near the end of the path. The next room has a thousand tiny paths to take, as well as rocks to mine.

|* Natural Tunnel |

Head west; along the way is a rock to break which may have a Loot Bag inside the hole it's covering (there are plenty of rocks like this). The nearby chest at the end of the path has an '''''[[Orange Gel]]'''''.

Now head for the eastern path to the south. Mine the first rock, just south of the entrance, and crawl in the hole for '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x4'''''. At the bottom of the path is a '''''[[Soba Omelette (Small)]]'''''. Take the path southwest for an earthquake, then mine the north and south walls to create paths, and head through the south one. The next rock you come to may lead to a Loot Bag, and the one in the passage near it leads to '''''[[Melange Gel]] x3'''''.

At the fork, go northeast and one of the rocks in the passage, which leads to '''''[[Gold Dust]] x7'''''. Return to the fork and take the north route. One of the rocks in the passage leads to an '''''[[Earth Cape]]'''''. Near the cliff's edge is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Backpack]]'''''.

|* Shaft 4 |

Mine your way west, take the northeast path at the fork, then south at the main shaft to a '''''[[Life Bottle]]''''' and a rock to break, leading to '''''[[Blue Jasmine]]'''''. North of that area, on the west wall, is a rock covering a hole (with a Loot Bag inside, if anything) across from it. At the north tip of the area is '''''[[Fossilized Shell]] x10''''', and, immediately to the west of it is an Aifread's Treasure containing '''''[[5000 gald]]'''''.

Before continuing to the west, take the south path for '''''[[Insect Wings]] x6''''', and a rock covering a hole. Further along the path is a second rock that leads to '''''[[Savory]]'''''. Back to the main path, head straight west to bump into '''''[[Hard Hat]]'''''. On the wall opposite the chest is a rock covering a hole. All the way south is '''''[[Apple Gel]] x3''''', a rock covering the way to '''''[[Sage]]''''', as well as another rock over a hole.

Break the east wall, but head northwest at the fork. Break the rock through there to claim '''''[[2500 gald]]''''' on the other side. Break the wall, if you want, and proceed to the Memory Ring and next room, '''Monster Nest'''. You know where this is going.

This one has a spray attack and burrows underground to attack, but isn't particularly fast or hard hitting. However, when you get his HP down to a certain point, he does have a fairly fast underground attack that keeps following you; backstep from it. Jude has a variety of good linked artes with Leia, but Pixie Heal is particularly useful. Annoyingly, this guy will summon Worm Shades. Don't divert your attention to them; big guy will cause you more problems than a spell every so often. On higher difficulties, Arteseal is an annoyance.

It would not be a bad idea to knock him down (and again in the next battle!) for that stealable item.

Those items he just dropped should come in handy.

He hits harder this time, and has more than double the HP. Not to mention he inflicts Arteseal! Have someone equip Seal Charm, and everyone else can have a Seal Ward. Don't link with Leia except for stealing and the very occasional linked arte; she'll back off and heal if she isn't attached to you, and the battle will go more smoothly. The major thing to watch out for is that he sometimes lunges forward, instead of up, when underground. He also likes to stun a lot and even grab you like the smaller worms. Toward the end, he'll get ridiculously fast with going underground, then he'll start causing rocks to fall. And yes, he'll summon a worm again.

Before leaving, claim the treasures '''''[[4000 gald]]''''' and '''''[[Lemon Gel]] x2'''''. Warp to Leronde.

==Chapter 2==

===Leronde===

First of all, go back to the guy in the inn to complete [[Heavy Metal Collector]], then go to the '''Mathis Clinic''', then the Seahaven. After that, go into the '''Mathis Clinic - Archives''' for a hilarious sub event, [[Milla and Books]]. Right next to the entrance of the clinic, talk to Ellen to rest, and head to the inn for the next scene. Talk to Sonia at the inn afterward for [[Leia's Disappearance]]. Now go on to the Seahaven and, after the scene, get '''''[[Leia's Notes]]'''''.

Note that everyone that rejoined has new equipment -- [[Air Rod]], [[Striped Ribbon]], [[Silver Cloak]], [[Tourbillon]], [[Hunting Beret]], [[Silver Coat]], [[Stormbringer]], [[Hard Hat]], and [[Battle Suit]].

|* Lakutam Seahaven |

*NEW SKITS AVAILABLE:
** '''''[[Leia the Stowaway]]''''', '''''[[(Getting it Over With)]]''''', '''''[[In Good Hands]]''''', '''''[[Leia's Notes (Skit)]]'''''
** On Lakutam Highroad: '''''[[(Childhood Memories)]]''''', '''''[[(The Sea at Sunset)]]''''', '''''[[The Aspyrixis]]'''''
+

=--Note...--=
Listen to every word in this section or die.

...Or miss a couple skits. You can buy them in the grade shop if you miss 'em.
=-=

Attempt to leave town for a scene. Now leave, and get all the skits you see listed (mainly the first two, but you might as well get the third). You will not see them otherwise.

Return to the Seahaven.

Go to the bulletin board for the final part of [[The Message]], then go north toward the downward stairs to automatically trigger [[Milla's Pendant (Event)]]. Continue north from there for [[The Edge of the World]] to appear, then talk to the man nearby for [[The Topknot Master]]. On the opposite side of the area, talk to the two ladies for the first part of [[Sisterhood]]. Finally, talk to the guy across from the accessory shop for [[Buried Treasure]] and a '''''[[Rare Vase]]'''''.

Might as well take care of [[Buried Treasure]] now; the shop you want is facing the Highroad exit. While in Sharilton, head to the '''Central Plaza''' and talk to the lady near the south exit for [[Orange Soup]]. Food Vendor must be level 5 or higher to buy one, so it should be easy. Approach the east mansion at '''Lord's Manor Gates''' for [[Rowen's Honor]].

=--Note...--=
You get to pick between a sub event and a skit. Either do Alvin and Derrick, or get a skit later on. Why? Dunno, but as far as Drache can tell, that's the condition for the skit to appear. Again, you can always buy skits in the grade shop later.

Also, don't enter Leronde's Inn. You'll miss another skit if you do that sidequest too early.
=-=

Back to '''Leronde''', near the Voltea Woods Entrance. Talk to the guy right by the exit for [[The Elder's Plea]] and '''''[[Ex-Miner's Wine]]'''''.

Back inside the inn, and talk to Warrick for [[Beat the Bandits]] (this request is probably too much for you, at the moment), then to the Clinic for [[Alvin and Derrick]]. Go ahead and deliver the Wine to Felgana Mine's deepest part (southern tip of that room) and return to finish the request.

Be sure that your equipment is top notch before proceeding. If you're anything like Drache (stingy), then it's been a couple bosses since you bothered upgrading.

Hug the southern wall to come to a '''''[[Link Ward]]'''''. Continue following the wall for a cavity containing '''''[[Blue Sage]]'''''. Northwest of there, on the opposite wall, is a cavity leading to '''''[[3000 gald]]'''''. On the north side of the pillar between the two exits is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Colored Sunglasses]]'''''. A little to the west, by a small rock, is '''''[[Syrup Bottle]] x2'''''. You can't climb the cliff, so off to the exit you can get to.

|* Central Region |

Scene, just a couple steps in. By a rock to the southwest is '''''[[Veggie Sticks (Small)]]'''''. Near the opposite wall is '''''[[Mysterious Liquid]] x9'''''. Then go all the way south for a hole leading to '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''. On the northern stretch of the area, climb up the west cliff and check the northwestern tip of the area, on the rock near the wall, is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Skill Tome: "Soul Dividend"]]'''''. In a hole in the wall just north of there is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''. Carry on to the '''Northeast Region'''. Note that a Memory Ring is thrown in front of you.

Be careful to not get trapped against the edge, or in front of his charge; if you aren't guarding, you'll probably die. One of the more annoying things he does is summon the local monsters to assist him. If you have subpar equipment, he's absolutely going to kill you. Even with the best you can get, he hits incredibly hard, so block or die. There's no fast or easy way; bring a lot of items. He's also capable of stunning and inflicting Linkseal, as well as digging underground to attack you (backstep away from that one). As he dies, he'll rampage around and call a bunch of enemies. Obnoxious, but can be dealt with.

From where are you taken (orange dot on the map), look southwest for a boulder (it'll be pretty close to you and on the west side of the trail); behind it is '''''[[Panacea Bottle]] x3'''''. Behind the large rock column to the northwest is a '''''[[Life Bottle]]'''''. Hug the east wall; toward the southern part of it is a hole you can enter for '''''[[Mysterious Bead]] x6''''' Climb the cliff and look for a hole near its northernmost point for a '''''[[Rosemary]]'''''. Go to the '''Southwest Region''' for a '''''[[Treat]]''''' at the cliff's edge. To the next town!

You'll be stuck in a series of scenes. Poke around in the inn's rooms for a '''''[[Dark Bottle]]''''', a '''''[[Holy Bottle]]''''', and a '''''[[Syrup Bottle]]'''''. The shops are up the elevator if you need 'em. Just above the boat leading to the Xagut Floodmeadow (you'll have to talk to someone if you want to go there) is [[The Wandering Youth]].

To find a scene about Wyverns, take the northeast elevator. It's east of the central bridge and up the north stairs. Next to the statue by the west exit is the first part of '''''[[The History of Auj Oule]]'''''. Head up the elevator at the northwest section of the area for the beginning of [[The Cause of Shifting Spirit Climes]]. Then take the boat at the north end of the area to reach the '''Coliseum'''. Talk to Yurgen twice for a fight, then sleep at the inn to have the party split in half.

As Milla, go back to the place where the rock fell. As Jude, head to the east side of the bridge. Afterward, head to the Coliseum and enter the tournament. It'll be easy to get through the first three battles. And then plot happens, and people separate again.

For Milla, go across the bridge and take the south stairs up to bump into a scene, then cross the bridge again for another. For Jude, head north from the inn to bump into a scene, then cross the bridge. At the Coliseum... a fun scene and boss. You won't have access to Alvin or Elize for this fight.

After the fight, head back to the coliseum and go all the way up the stairs for [[And the Winner Is...]]. By the exit to the Royal Hunting Grounds is [[Punish the Poachers]].

But first, short stop in '''Leronde''', now that you've seen '''''[[Runaway Teen]]'''''. Head in its inn for the first part of [[Memories of Leronde]].

In the Gathering Points here, be sure to get a Peach Elephant Tusk for [[Pretty and Pink]].

From the entrance, go northwest and climb up one level. Along the wall is a hole leading to '''''[[Lavender]]'''''. Follow the wall to the next platform to climb up and a '''''[[Mind Ward]]'''''. Head south to the opposite wall's elevated region for a hole containing '''''[[Hazardous Liquid]] x5'''''. Follow the wall east and look in the second set of trees you see for Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Topknot]]'''''. This is related to [[The Topknot Master]]. Drop down the cliff and hug the east wall till you find a hole containing '''''[[Specific]]'''''.

|* Central Region |

In the corner to the north of the entrance is a '''''[[Beef Bowl (Small)]]'''''. Continue following that wall to come to a cliff. Up there is a hole leading to '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x6'''''. The rock in front of the hole has Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]''''' on it. Just to the north of the cliff on the opposite wall is '''''[[Panacea Bottle]] x2'''''. Along the easternmost cliff's wall is a hole leading to '''''[[3000 gald]]'''''.

|* North Region |

By a tree to the north of the entrance is '''''[[Fur]] x8'''''. Climb the nearby cliff to fight the bandits for [[Punish the Poachers]]. Then claim the '''''[[Melange Gel]]''''' behind them. At the top of the southern cliff is a cavity containing '''''[[Treat]]'''''. Up the northern cliff is another cavity which has '''''[[Blue Savory]]'''''. In the east wall, close to the boulders by the central cliff, is a hole in the wall leading to '''''[[4000 gald]]'''''. That's all for this area.

You may find a Bronze Bacura here. It's a boss type, but weaker than your average story boss. Make sure to have your healer set to Prioritize Healing. They also appear in a future area, so don't feel like you have to fight it immediately... though you should be able to handle it.

This place is a four layered mess. Head into '''Sector 9''' to the west for '''''[[Tofu Miso Soup (Small)]]'''''. Outside, head all the way north for '''''[[Giant Shell]] x7'''''. Head around to the south side, and follow the path all the way to a '''''[[Stone Ward]]'''''. Cross the bridge to come to a '''''[[Battle Guard]]'''''. Enter '''Sector 7''', then exit to the other side.

Jump down to the second layer and enter '''Sector 4''' for a '''''[[Treat]]'''''. Now enter the neighboring '''Sector 3'''; go to the northeast room for a '''''[[Life Bottle]]''''', then exit to the southwest. Take the outside path all the way south to get '''''[[Melange Gel]]'''''. Cross the bridge, but stop where the first one passes above it. On the higher bridge is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Goofy Glasses]]'''''. Carry on to the east for a '''''[[Syrup Bottle]]'''''. Enter '''Sector 5''' for '''''[[Blue Basil]]''''', then go to '''Sector 6'''. The second south path has '''''[[2000 gald]]'''''... and the rest of your party!

|* After Reuniting |

Exit south, and hop down to the third layer. Enter '''Sector 1''' to the west, but before leaving, right next to the other exit is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Skill Tome: "Gifted Healer"]]'''''. Outside is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''. Back to the other side of Sector 1, and follow the circle till it branches northeast for '''''[[Crown Feather]] x10''''', then enter '''Sector 2''' for '''''[[Verbena]] x5'''''. Outside, the bottom layer has '''''[[Middy Blouse]]''''' and '''''[[3000 gald]]'''''. Now start the trek outta here. No world map warping, which mean you'll come to a scene... poor Elize. Carry along the bridge to get Elize back.

There's going to be a lot of subquesting, going by all the skits around. Finish off [[Punish the Poachers]] by talking to the person by the Hunting Grounds exit. To fiiiiinally meet Alvin's mother for the first part of [[Mother and Child]], head up the south stairs, take the elevator, and enter the residence. Afterward, talk to her again to complete the event. Poke around the house for a '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''.

Cross the bridge to come to a scene. Then head for the hotel to start [[The Aftermath]]. Also in the inn is Karla, who you can speak to for the second part of [[The History of Auj Oule]]. Head for the coliseum and talk to the guy up the stairs for [[Potent Potions of the Kitarl Clan]], and go ahead and give him what he wants (if you don't have one, you can go to Xagut Floodmeadow or Labari Hollow). You can fight at the coliseum, now.

Plot? What plot? Time to do some optional areas. Take the boat to Xagut Floodmeadow. And yes, there will be more sidequesting after that.

The enemies here are somewhat strong for you, but manageable. Be very careful around Gentlemen; they're quite strong, but give good EXP. Follow the south wall; by a tree roughly southeast of the boat is '''''[[Basil]]'''''. Directly east of there, on a tree near the east wall, is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[10000 gald]]'''''. Just southwest of there, by a rock, is '''''[[Verbena]]'''''. At the southern tip of the area is a hole leading to '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''. Near the exit is the guy you need to speak with to finish [[The Wandering Youth]].

|* Northeast Region |

Look between the trees to the west for '''''[[Jasmine]]'''''. Drop down to the second layer and head all the way to the eastern tip of the area for '''''[[Omega Elixir]]'''''. Down to the next layer; near the west wall is '''''[[Great Tree's Fruit]] x2'''''. Take the southeast exit.

=--Note...--=
Take the southwest exit if you really want, but ''DO NOT FIGHT THE CAT''. It's a Devil's Beast and will absolutely curbstomp you.
=-=

|* Southeast Region |

Follow the west wall to find a hole leading to '''''[[5000 gald]]''''', then follow the opposite wall south to find '''''[[Savory]]''''' near a rock by the wall. Jump down the cliff; right below it is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x10'''''. Not-so-hidden on the north wall is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Black Dog's Muzzle]]'''''. Continue following that wall to come to '''''[[Saffron]]'''''.

|* South Region |

Head to the eastern tip of the area to find '''''[[Chamomile]]''''', and west from there, about in the middle of the area, is '''''[[Lavender]]'''''.

|* Odds and Ends |

Head toward the rappigs for a scene with the people who gave Milla her glass bead... For Milla, there's an easy fight, and for Jude, there's a separate scene with Ivar. This completes [[Milla's Pendant]].

Now head to '''Sharilton''' and give the pink obsessed twins their Peach Elephant Tusk for the second part of [[Pretty and Pink]].

At '''Lakutam Seahaven''', return to the Topknot Master to finish [[The Topknot Master]]. Moe. Head to the inn for [[Spirit Clime Trouble]]. This won't be any trouble; head to the pond at '''Lakutam Highroad - Central Region''' and take 'em out.

Finally, head to the bottom of '''Labari Hollow''' for [[Infiltrate the Research Center]]. Yes, Tales, you are a butthole series when it comes to sidequests. And Drache is the sort to hold grudges; she still remembers her third playthrough for a certain spear for a certain Krityan.

If you don't have this place unlocked, go so Voltea Woods - Northeast Branch and crawl in the hole to the northeast.

First of all, watch out for the Gentlegnomes. They're about as strong as Gentlemen, but at least have a weakness to exploit... and they're good for EXP, particularly with food. If you ever want to grind, these guys are a good choice.

=--Note...--=
Another Devil's Beast is coming up. AVOID.
=-=

Head east for '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x10'''''. Right as the path turns, along the east wall, is a SNEAKY hole leading to '''''[[Dragon Ash]] x3'''''. Now head into the west room. The pillar to the north has Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Rage Glasses]]'''''. Beat up the bandits for [[Beat the Bandits]], then jump down to the lower southern area (and be sure to avoid that Beast). At the western end is '''''[[Specific Plus]]'''''.

Go to the '''North Region''' of the mine. Go into the west area and check behind the second rock there for Aifread's treasure, '''''[[Skill Tome: "Pinprick"]]''''', and in the wall southwest of there is a hole containing '''''[[Echore]]'''''. Don't equip the Tome's skill unless you want to try for huge combos. Now take the north path; at the west end is '''''[[Red Jasmine]]''''', and at on the east end, along the south wall, is a hole you can crawl into for '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''. That's it for here.

|* Leronde |

Talk to Warrick at the Lodge to complete [[Beat the Bandits]].

Now on to the main event: Xian Du's west exit is where you want to go.

You will be able to find Heart Herbs here for [[The Aftermath]]. Bronze Bacura also appear here, if you didn't see one at Labari Hollow.

Northwest of the entrance is a hole leading to '''''[[Mysterious Bead]] x5'''''. Head to the first tree along the opposite wall for '''''[[Pointy Talons]] x8''''', then the hole just north of there, which leads to '''''[[Chamomile]]'''''. Continue to the '''Central Region'''.

Follow the west wall till it turns; you'll find '''''[[Geode]] x7''''' nearby. Keep following that wall to come to a hole containing '''''[[3000 gald]]'''''. On a tree a little east of the northwest exit is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Sideburns]]'''''. A little east of there is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x4'''''. Continue to the east wall, and search to the north for a cavity containing '''''[[Light Cape]]'''''. Exit northeast.

|* Silent Cave |

Head east for '''''[[Blue Verbena]]''''', then follow the north path to the end for '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''. Hug the east wall of the path till you find a hole to crawl in; you'll wind up in the area leading to the north exit. Take it to reach the '''North Branch'''.

Right next to the entrance is '''''[[Elixir]]''''', and the northeast end of the area has '''''[[4000 gald]]'''''. From there, hug the wall and follow it south; the boulder you bump into has Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Skill Tome: "Joyful Gains"]]''''', on it. Continue following the wall to come to a hole containing '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''. Go all the way back to the Central Region, then take the northwest exit.

|* Northwest Region |

Follow the wall north for a '''''[[Pot au Feu (Small)]]''''' in a hole. On the opposite wall, go east from the entrance for a '''''[[Treat]]''''', and further east for a cavity with '''''[[Orange Gel]] x3''''' inside. East of the exit to Kanbalar, by a tree, is '''''[[Pineapple Gel]]'''''.

Rest at the inn for a scene. Look around the room for a '''''[[Syrup Bottle]]''''', and check the south room for a '''''[[Dark Bottle]]'''''. Enter the '''Residential Ward - Plaza''' for a scene. Right next to where you wind up is someone you can talk to for [[Runaway Rappig]]. Enter the nearby residence for '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]''''', then sleep at the inn again for [[Real Talk]]. Next to the Mon Highlands exit is [[Survival of the Fittest]].

Now leave for '''Mon Highlands - Central Region''' to find that rappig (a green dot on the map) and kill the mob by Silent Cave's entrance. Back to Kanbalar to finish the two sub events.

Head toward the castle for a scene with King Hottie, then enter and head north for another... and fight your way out of there.

Presa is capable of throwing stuff at you (it stuns!) and casting artes. Stay on her; the AI cannot be relied upon to prevent her from casting artes, so they're better off occupying Wingul. Avoid getting close to both of them; one will shred you while the other will use that time to cast artes. It's impossible to leave the trap once in it. Separate, they're easy. Together, you're probably dead. And they will come together, like your own AI allies do, to protect each other, so you're just going to have to find a way to survive during those moments.

On higher difficulties, they may confuse you. Definitely the most obnoxious of ailments. Wingul also tends to like casting Arrivederci and Flame Ring. His spells are much less deadly than Presa's; they're more of an annoyance.

Near the stairs leading to the Xagut Floodmeadow boat is a person you can talk to for the first part of [[Poetry and Dictionaries]]. Head toward the inn for a scene, the second part of [[Those Who Act in Shadow]], then rest at the inn, now that you have a [[Heart Herb]], for [[The Aftermath]]. '''Hic'''. On the second floor of the inn is Karla, for the third part of [[The History of Auj Oule]]. For the fourth part, head to the Coliseum and go up the stairs to talk to Karla once again.

Now, to '''Hamil''' for [[Reawakened Memories]]. Before moving on, enter the residence for [[Find the Villagers]]. To complete these events, go to '''Aladhi Seahaven''' for an automatic scene, then to '''Xian Du's''' bridge. Return to '''Hamil''' to meet the new residents for [[It Does a Body Good]]. To finish that request, talk to the guy near the chickens/rappigs in Nia Khera and return to the client to activate [[The Mystery of Dodurians]].

In '''Leronde''', talk to Warrick to learn how to open the fruit. Once he moves out of the way, check the counter for the sidequest mentioned in the skit, the second part of [[Memories of Leronde]]. Head to the Mathis Clinic for [[Jude's Substitute]]. To '''Hamil''' once again to complete the event... and see the change!

At '''Xian Du''', finish [[Reawakened Memories]] by heading for the bridge. Time to move on with the plot; talk to Yurgen by the wyverns... and a boss that might be familiar to anyone that played Vesperia.

A very mobile boss; hard to keep hitting. Obnoxiously, it spins to attack a very wide range which can keep staggering you, over and over. It's possible to get inside the attack radius so he can't hit you, though. It can also inflict you with Curse with its beam of darkness attack, along with Paralysis from another attack. Elize's Dispel is invaluable (if you don't have it, use the Jude/Elize Recover Heal). Since it's weak to water, Rowen isn't a bad choice for his Splash and Blue Sphere, as well as for Spash Beam (Rowen/Jude). Later in the fight, it starts to use fireballs and whirlwinds.

Overall, not a difficult boss. Just hard to keep in one place except with knockdown attacks.

Bronze Bacuras appear here.

Right next to you is a cavity leading to '''''[[Basil]]'''''. Swing by '''Fort Gandala''' for '''''[[Elixir]]''''' at the north end, then check the south end, behind some boxes, for Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Omega Elixir]]'''''. Back in '''Barnauer Highroad''', west from the Gandala exit between a few trees is '''''[[Mushroom Powder]] x8''''', then follow the south wall to a hole containing another '''''[[Elixir]]'''''. Jump down at the cliff; by a tree to the south is '''''[[Apple Gel]] x3'''''. Crawl in the nearby hole in the cliff for '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]'''''. Exit west to '''Southwest Branch'''.

Near the west body of water is '''''[[Panacea Bottle]] x3'''''. Head to the east cliff from there; in its southern corner is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Devil Wings]]'''''. Up the cliff is '''''[[3500 gald]]''''' and, north of there, a hole containing '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x6'''''. Take the east exit.

|* Central Region |

There's nothing on top of this cliff, so drop down at the easternmost point, and turn around to find a cavity containing '''''[[Magic Emblem]]'''''. Follow the south wall to find '''''[[Buzzard Talon]] x9''''' by a rock. Northeast of there, by a normal tree (and south of a glowy one) is '''''[[Fruit Salad (Small)]]'''''. The wall nearby has a hole containing '''''[[Blue Lavender]]'''''. Head to the '''Northwest Region'''.

Hug the south wall and head east. On the wall, at about the halfway point between exits, is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Skill Tome: "Warrior Above"]]'''''. A hole leading to '''''[[Melange Gel]]''''' is on the wall northwest of there. Head east to a glowing tree to find '''''[[Pineapple Gel]]''''', then head northeast and follow the wall to a cavity with '''''[[Pointy Talons]] x10'''''. To Fennmont!

If you're on Milla's path, there are some items you need to fetch:

* Talim Medical School - Examination Room 5: '''''[[Life Bottle]]'''''
* Talim Medical School - Teaching Wing: '''''[[Orange Gel]]'''''

Right in front of the exit is a lady you can talk to for [[A Message to the Fortress]] and '''''[[Letter to Father]]'''''. Go ahead and complete that request. A little girl next to the south exit is attached to the final part of [[The Runaways]]. On the second floor of the '''Trading Post''' is [[Year End Sell-off]], which should be easy enough to complete (gather loot at Barnauer Highroad if you don't have a [[Meadow Crystal]]).

Head inside '''Talim Medical School - Student Services''' and head east for [[The Cycle of Rieze Maxia]] to automatically trip (if you're on Jude's path, you already got this). The southeast corner has another sub event, [[Doing Research for a Report]], to trigger. Go to Xagut Floodmeadow if you don't have a [[Monster Fluid]].

...Now, for something completely out of the way! Go to the manor in '''Sharilton''' and talk to Driselle for the final part of [[Poetry and Dictionaries]].

With that trip out of the way, head for the '''Research Center''' for a scene. Go to '''Sector 3''', then head all the way up the stairs for another scene, and enter the door in front of you. Climb the ladder and check the machine. Now out to Fennmont; your target is next to the '''Trading Post'''.

Strangely low stats, for a boss, and she has an odd obsession with using Lemon Gels (steal it to make her stop).

But! She'll throw the first Mystic Arte of the game on you, which will harm the entire party (maybe even kill someone, if you're unlucky). Don't be afraid to use a Treat after it... and bring out Elize, if you haven't, so she can Dispel and protect against Burn. If you see her overlimit, run. Your linked partner will follow you, at least, and she'll hopefully chase you through her entire overlimit instead of unleashing a Mystic Arte. The reason for this is because, to unleash a Mystic Arte, an Arcane Arte must connect with its target first. This applies to both you and the enemy.

As she dies, she'll spam a fire attack that hits a small area around her; it's hard to get a hit in if you stay too close to her. Mystic Arte aside, she's generally a pushover.

Naturally, you can just bust your way into the palace. No problem. On 2F, fight your way to the next room. Enter the southwest door, Guard Garrison 1, for an '''''[[Earth Cap]]'''''.

Exit to the Entrance Hall through the northeast door, and turn around to find Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Party Hat]]''''', then head up the stairs to fight your way through another door.

In 3F, Archives 1 has an '''''[[All-Divide]]''''', '''''[[Lemon Gel]]''''', and a chest containing '''''[[Pineapple Gel]]'''''. The Conference Room has a chest with a '''''[[Rune Circlet]]''''', a '''''[[Melange Gel]]''''', and a '''''[[Treat]]'''''.

You have a Dark Cape from this very dungeon; equip it on whoever you think needs it the most. Also, you can steal an Amethyst from him, which you ought to equip immediately. He really likes darkness.

One of the things he likes to do is impale and toss you to the ground. He's also capable of cursing you, so, like always, Elize is a good idea. It's also a good idea to have at least one caster in the back, that way your party isn't taken out all at once.

At times, he'll change his blade to one emanating darkness, and his attacks will pack more of a punch. Then, when he's in overlimit, he'll try spamming Tyrant Spear to try and hit you with his Mystic Arte. STAY. BACK. Luckily, this doesn't hit everyone; just whoever happens to be in reach -- but beware, if everyone is in front of him, they're all as good as dead. (Drache only had Leia survive once. Guess who had the Amethyst equipped.) If everyone gets bunched together, RUN. That should get your linked partner to follow you, at least, which will spare part of your team from potential annihilation. Make sure to set the strategies to keep your frail allies away.

He can cast some artes; if you're ready for them, you can simply run out of their range. He can also stab his sword into the ground; while that attack can follow you, it's fairly easy to also run away from.

Finally, a true three on four battle. Don't overuse casters; you want one caster (probably Elize for healing) and three people to be (mostly) bait. The problem with casters is that they'll probably be targeted in the middle of casting, making them useless. Focus on Jiao; he's definitely the most dangerous and the most obnoxious. He is capable of healing, somehow, so you'll need to seriously use your best wind attacks toward the end.

Note that these people can link. When one overlimits, the other can Mystic Arte away, so try to stay on the unlinked one and let the AI get murdered instead. And if one overlimits alone... again, let the AI be murdered. Fairy Circle (Milla/Elize and Milla/Leia) is actually quite helpful, as it whittles down Jiao's health and keeps up your own. But you're stuck in place, so beware using it.

The worst part? They can confuse you. Try to keep Dispel up. (That arte is simply divine. Elize is always welcome to the party.)

Try to spam your own Mystic Artes in this battle; you need to be in overlimit, then use an Arcane Arte (you probably only have a few, at this point) and holds X. They're increasingly going to go into Overlimit as they die; be patient, don't rush, and you can survive the Mystic Arte hell.

...And now a light based boss with a crap ton of attack. He has some lovely beam attacks, as well as one that wraps around him. He also likes Beast, which knocks you down, and multi-hit sword attacks. Like other bosses, he'll use Mystic Artes, and thus you should RUUUUN when he overlimits. He only hits the people in range, but it will kill whoever gets caught. As he dies, his attacks get crazier, and he starts to confuse you (jerk!).

Be patient; guard when you have to, try to only use life bottles for your main and best healer, and only approach when it's relatively safe. This battle is something of a slog, or maybe even a war of attrition, but only because he hits hard.

Biological inaccuracies abound -- no place with trees is a tundra! :D

Check the northeast corner for '''''[[Peach Pie (Small)]]'''''. On a tree southwest of the Memory Ring is Aifread's Treasure '''''[[Swordsman's Eyepatch]]''''', and along the east wall near the south exit (to Fezebel Marsh) is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''. Take the north exit to the '''North Region'''.

Follow the west wall; the first rock you come by will have '''''[[Red Saffron]]''''' on the other side. There's a tree just as the path turns north; beside it is '''''[[4000 gald]]'''''. North of there, along the wall, is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Omega Elixir]]'''''. It's easier to see if you go south along the wall.

It'd be a good idea to equip a Stun Bracelet or Talisman.

They can link. Alvin/Jude should link to take out one of the dragons. If one of them starts to harass Elize too much, link with her and start smacking the other dragon till you feel safe unlinking again. Due to the dragons linking, this shouldn't be a huge problem; they'll both pick the same target eventually. The biggest problem is when you get stuck between the two; you're otherwise going to be okay with their damage output.

Very obnoxiously, the dragons can heal. You'll just have to muscle your way through that, as far as Drache can tell.

Whether you go north or south, you'll find the party.

Follow the south wall to '''''[[4000 gald]]'''''. Northeast of there, on a tree, is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Heart Eyepatch]]''''', and right behind it is '''''[[Pearl]] x8'''''. Go back to the other wall and follow it south to '''''[[Seaweed Salad (Small)]]''''', and continue south for a scene. You'll be taken to the '''North Region''' automatically.

Head south along the west wall; on the boulder is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Omega Elixir]]'''''. Up the cliff is '''''[[Red Jasmine]]'''''. Just south of the second cliff is '''''[[Lemon Gel]]''''', and southwest of there, along the wall, is '''''[[Red Sage]]'''''. Now you can go where you're supposed to.

Gotta love them shops out in the middle of nowhere. Yup.

On the south wall, just after it turns west, is a hole hiding '''''[[Life Bottle]] x2'''''. Follow the path all the way to the west for a '''''[[Miracle Gel]]'''''. On the north path, on the east wall just beyond the vines to climb up, is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Skill Tome: "Wall of Soul"]]'''''. At the end of the path is '''''[[Red Savory]]'''''. Climb up the vines and continue along for a scene and fight. Check the northwest corner of the small area for a hole containing '''''[[Flame Cape]]'''''. Head to the '''Central Region'''.

At the tip of the east path is '''''[[Specific]]'''''. In the west path, on the west wall just north of the loop, is a hole leading to '''''[[Iron Leggings]]'''''. At the fork, head south for a '''''[[Gothic Cardigan]]''''', then head north to come to a '''''[[Spicy Chicken Roll (Small)]]'''''. Climb the vines; on the south wall is a hole with '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x4''''' inside, and, at the end of the path is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[10000 gald]]'''''. Go to the '''Lake Area''' and proceed along the path for a fight. Do equip Barrier Soul on Milla; it's quite handy.

He likes to spin around and knock you down, and he summons monsters. All of his attacks are big enough to hit you a backstep away, but that's his biggest quirk. Quite the step down from Gaius, huh? He's not very threatening, even when he steps up the attacks as he dies.

In the '''North Region''', follow the tunnel till it opens up to a wider area and check the east wall for a cavity containing '''''[[Saffron]]''''' along the east wall.

For both Jude and Milla, you start at the top of a cliff; the south one for Jude, and the west one for Milla. The following instructions are just from different perspectives.

|* Milla |

Jump down from the cliff and search the south wall for a hole containing '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''. Follow the north wall to a boulder; on the other side is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Full-frame Glasses]]'''''. Continue along the north wall for '''''[[Red Basil]]'''''. Then take the east wall south till you find a hole containing '''''[[Seafood Stew (Small)]]'''''. Continue following the wall till you find a second Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Sephira]]'''''.

|* Jude |

At the bottom level, hug search the east wall for Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Sephira]]''''', then continue north along the wall to find a hole containing '''''[[Seafood Stew (Small)]]'''''. By a rock against the north wall is '''''[[Red Basil]]'''''. From there, follow the north wall to the next boulder; on it is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Full-frame Glasses]]'''''. Finally, follow the opposite wall west to a hole containing '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''.

|* Xailen Woods Temple |

=--Note...--=
''Do not talk to Wingul.'' You will be able to do that sub event before the final boss, and you'll get a new skit for it.
=-=

Seem familiar? Note that the rest of the party has new armor. Head inside the temple for another scene. Go outside to talk to Agria/Presa for [[Jiao's Demise]]. Rest in the temple (west room Milla; east Jude) to go on. Don't you love how no one uses sheets? There's only once place for you to go, as you can't open any of the doors. Afterward, take the north exit to Kanblar's rooftops.

Head toward the '''Main Road''' for a scene. It's just a straight path to the castle. A bunch of easy fights ahead. Despite the music, the Spyrix Sentries are regular Guard type enemies. They just happen to have a lot of HP and are stronger than the mooks you just took down.

Afterward, you'll be in Kanbalar. Around the next room in the castle are two scenes (different for both main characters). Exit the castle to find Jude/Milla. Rejoin everyone. DON'T MOVE; if you do, you miss a skit (so Drache believes, anyway). After those (particularly the Local Delicacy skit), head just a little toward the exit again for a scene... and the second part of [[Sisterhood]]. In the Audience Chamber, talk to Wingul for [[Jiao and Wingul]].

Before taking off, head to the inn to find Karla, as the final part of [[The History of Auj Oule]]. In the north room, talk to the guy on the bed for [[Monsters in the Cave]].

If you're on Jude's path, this will send you to the dungeon Milla was just in, and vice versa. In both, you'll be fighting bosses... made easier by having a full party. For Jude, scroll on. For Milla, click [[Kukhar Ice Caverns (Milla)]].

For the plot, talk to Gaius and click [[E.S.S. Zenethra]].

To get to the Tubes, climb up the west cliff at Xailen Woods.

Grab the '''''[[Silver Ore]] x20''''' at the south point and climb up the cliff. Hug the south wall to find a hole containing '''''[[Monster Fluid]] x5''''', then head all the way west for an '''''[[Apple Gel]]'''''. Climb the cliff beyond the loop and to the small opening; there, in the north wall, you'll find a cavity containing '''''[[Saffron]]'''''.

At the Lake Area, see [[BOSS BATTLE #15-M]] for any details regarding the Fire Teagle. It should be easy, since you have a full party.


At the '''Central Region''', across from the cliff is '''''[[Spicy Chicken Roll (Small)]]'''''. On top of the cliff, follow the south wall to find a hole with '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x4''''' inside, then head to the end of the path for Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[10000 gald]]'''''. Down the cliff, and to the south point for a '''''[[Gothic Cardigan]]'''''. Continue further along the path, hugging the west wall for '''''[[Iron Leggings]]'''''. Continue towards the exit, but head east, then all the way to the northern tip for a '''''[[Specific]]'''''.

Once you get to the '''South Region''', check the northwest corner of the small area you come to for a hold hiding '''''[[Flame Cape]]'''''. Then jump down the cliff you come and follow the wall north to find Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Skill Tome: "Wall of Soul"]]''''' on the east wall, as well as '''''[[Red Savory]]''''' at the end of the path. Jump down the next cliff to the south and head all the way west for '''''[[Miracle Gel]]'''''. Follow the south wall east for a hole hiding '''''[[Life Bottle]] x2'''''.

Do equip Barrier Soul on Milla; it's quite handy.

To get to the Caverns, climb up the south cliff at Xailen Woods.

At the northeast corner of the "8" shape on the map is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[10000 gald]]'''''. Head down the Southern Cliff; at the east end is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x6'''''. At the far west end of the map is '''''[[Monster Fluid]] x5'''''.

At the Lake Area, see [[BOSS BATTLE #15-J]] for any details regarding the Aquadragons. It should be easy, since you have a full party.

At the '''Central Region''', go to the north tip for '''''[[Takoyaki Ramen (Small)]]''''', then take the east turn at the end of the path for '''''[[Gothic Plate]]'''''. Follow the south wall to a cavity containing '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''. Up the cliff, then hug the western wall to come to a hole hiding '''''[[Iron Leggings]]'''''. Now go all the way to the east tip of the path for a '''''[[Treat]]'''''. Then head back and take the first turn south; on the wall there is Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Rosy Cheeks]]'''''.

Finally, from the '''South Region''', take the path all the way south to '''''[[Life Bottle]] x2'''''. Up the cliff, down the next, and turn north for '''''[[Mushroom Powder]] x7'''''. Follow the path around the bend and hug the north wall till you find a hole leading to '''''[[Aqua Cape]]'''''.

Exit south to Tulea Tundra.

Follow the west wall; before it turns, you'll come to Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Omega Elixir]]'''''. Just south of there is '''''[[4000 gald]]''''', then continue following along the wall till you find '''''[[Red Saffron]]''''' by a rock. In the '''South Region''', check the northeast corner for '''''[[Peach Pie (Small)]]'''''. On a tree southwest of the Memory Ring is Aifread's Treasure '''''[[Swordsman's Eyepatch]]''''', and along the east wall near the exit is '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''.

To continue with the plot, remember to talk to Gaius. And remember to return to the client at Kanbalar's inn.

It is possible to find a Silver Bacura here.

If you're on Jude's side, you will automatically find the Technician Captain and Stalwart Captain enemies for the first time. Milla's side featured them a while back.

At least the game never leaves you without supplies. At the '''Central Deck''' is a fight. Afterward, you get a '''''[[Radio]]''''' and '''''[[Zenethra Map]]'''''. This is... quite the ship. You're on the middle/second layer of the ship. To the west of the entrance is a '''''[[Treat]]''''', and the southeast corner has '''''[[Miracle Gel]]'''''. Head to the '''Central Hall''' for a scene, then head down the stairs for '''''[[Holy Bottle]] x2''''' and '''''[[Blue Sage]]'''''. Exit south to ''Starboard Area 1''.

|* Starboard Area 1 |

Periodically, you will hear the enemy talking about defending the port or starboard sides. More enemies will appear at those times; that's your best chance to fight a Golem.

Just next to the entrance is '''''[[Rotten Bone]] x15'''''. Along the main path, take the south stairs and pop outside for '''''[[Sacred Helm]]''''', then continue along the main path till you get to '''''[[3000 gald]]'''''. Next to the east exit is '''''[[Melange Gel]] x2'''''. Go to ''Area 2''. Follow the path the end for '''''[[Blue Savory]]''''' and a door. Inside the Stateroom is '''''[[Venomous Stinger]]''''' in a drawer and '''''[[Red Verbena]]''''' in a chest. Back to Area 1, take the lower south exit for '''''[[Apple Gel]] x2''''', then to warp to the Port side.

Once there, get the '''''[[Resistance Emblem]]''''' and exit to '''Port Area 1'''. Head west; eventually you'll come to the door leading to the starting area and '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x6'''''. Now back down the stairs, and take the lower path east. Take the south fork for '''''[[3000 gald]]''''', and south of the exit is '''''[[Croquette Parfait (Small)]]'''''.

|* Port Area 2 |

Go to the end of the southern corridor is '''''[[Orange Gel]] x2''''', then enter the west Stateroom room for '''''[[Jasmine]]''''' in a chest and '''''[[Beetle Leg]] x7''''' in the shelves.  In the neighboring room is '''''[[Amulet]]'''''. Continue to '''Area 3'''.

Skip the first door; you'll come back. Go all the way east for a '''''[[Pineapple Gel]]''''', and check the shelves in the nearby room for '''''[[Syrup Bottle]] x2'''''. Go to the far east door, the '''Port Engine Room''' for a scene and '''''[[Elixir]]'''''. Outside, head west and take the north door. You can grab one of the boxes; make a path with it to '''''[[4000 gald]]'''''. Now head for '''Area 1'''. Claim the '''''[[Bee's Nest]] x11''''' and head outside for a '''''[[Rare Metal]] x8'''''. Back in Area 3, head for the southwest door you skipped: the '''Port Lounge'''. Take '''''[[Everbloom]] x7''''' from a cupboard and '''''[[Reverse Doll]]''''' from a chest, then warp to Starboard.

|* Starboard Area 3 |

In the Starboard Lounge, claim '''''[[Dark Bottle]]''''' from a cupboard and '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5''''' in a chest. Outside to '''Area 3'''.

Stateroom 2, located to in Area 2 to the west of where you are, does not have treasure, but check it for loot if you want. Instead, look at the east end of the Area 3 corridor for '''''[[Phoenix Ribbon]]''''', then check around the nearby Stateroom 4 to the east for a '''''[[Heavy Treat]]''''' in the shelves. Swing around to the south side and enter the '''Starboard Engine Room''' for a scene. Back in Area 3, follow the corridor to Stateroom 3; move the one moveable box inside to get '''''[[Omega Elixir]]'''''. Then head to Area 2 for '''''[[Bizarre Clump]] x5''''', and to the deck for '''''[[Life Bottle]]'''''.

Now, make your way aaaalllllllll the way back to the other side of the ship. Stop at the supply/rest place if you need to. In the area beyond the bars, the '''Central Deck''', is a '''''[[Specific]]'''''. As for the Control Room...

Focus on Gilland first to get him out of the way (though Celsius will protect him at times, so beware). He has a very damaging beam attack that will probably wipe you out if you wind up in right front of it.

Celsius naturally has a variety of ice attacks; one surrounds her to knock you over, and she likes to follow that up with an attack exclusively for downed allies. She also inflicts a bunch of status effects.

They can also perform linked arts, which hit like a truck. Despite all that, they're not difficult so long as you focus on Gilland. Celsius has an Aquamarine to steal/equip, if you don't have one already.

You can equip a Reverse Doll, which you should have gotten in the previous dungeon. Alternatively, there's Black Onyx, Amulet (burn sucks), or Stun Talisman. Black Onyx is probably the least useful, but it can help you out of a pinch. Alternatively, you can try Stun Bracelet and Syrup Bottle together, and only equip the Reverse Doll or Black Onyx when you get caught in a combo or a tough spot.

Be warned -- he hits like a TRUCK. You will need to abuse free run and snap pivot if you want to survive. Try to free run around shots (if you see them coming) and snap pivot his sword swings. You can also approach him after he finishes attacking, but be careful. Use a knockdown attack, such as Beast, if you need to heal up. Ideally, don't get hit. Seriously, one of his combos can bring you down. Do use Steel; every bit of attack will help.

Toward the end, he'll heal himself using Guardian Field. Once he starts pulling that, consider spamming Demon Fist to prevent him from getting a full heal out of it.

You'll want Leia and Jude (or just Jude!) up front, so Rowen and Elize can hang back and do what they do best.

Muzet hits pretty hard, including behind her, so you will take quite the beating. You should be a little patient when approaching her, or else don't constantly link with a partner so they don't keep trying (and failing) to match your movements.

She also looooves ailments, so keep Dispel up. Her darkness spells tend to hold you in place or draw you in, so do your best to stay clear of those.

Once she overlimits, she'll spam long range magic suddenly... Block the stuff that follows you, if you can't run around it in time, and run away from any spells. One of your allies is sure to be dumb enough to get hit by her Mystic Arte, so keep your health way up, and use whatever you need to survive.

This time, Ivar actually packs a punch. And the jerk confuses you. This battle is obnoxious because it's hard to occupy both the wyvern and Ivar. Since Ivar is fast, you should handle him first. The wyvern might hit you from time to time, or kill Rowen, but he's not particularly threatening.

Ivar's Mystic Arte will reduce to 1 HP, but it hits multiple targets in his range... which can be everyone, if you're unlucky.

Take out Agria first. Why? Presa heals, so you'll need to focus a lot of attention on her to actually *kill* the woman. The Fire Djinns alone will divert attention away from Presa.

Other than the constant Mystic Arte spamming, this battle isn't that bad.

Follow the shinies. Once the world lights up enough to see, continue down the path to the blue orb and jump down. Then head to the next red one to really light up the place. Just continue till you find a few glowy orbs containing life bottles... and a nice place to jump.

You can find Silver Bacura, probably in any of these regions. Not the kind of fun to have on your own.

What are you wearing, Milla? (Not to mention her hair is worse than usual.) Talk to the spirits twice, then try to leave for a scene. Climb the west cliff to the '''West Beach'''. The chests should be familiar to you, but I will cover them again. Climb up the two cliffs, then down the south ones for '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x5'''''. Continue to the area by the Memory Ring, then take the trail east to '''''[[Sharp Pincers]] x11'''''. You can enter Nia Khera if you wish, to talk to the people there and listen to the spirits talk (it's interesting!), but head back to '''Below Falls''', then '''Central Area'''.

If we're in the Spirit Realm, does that mean we can pay with Spirit money? No? Darn. You can buy stuff from the shop, here by some miracle. Across from him, in the wall, is '''''[[French Toast (Large)]]'''''. Up the cliffs, then check the northwest for '''''[[Giant Fish Fin]] x6'''''. Head to the southeast side of the raised area and jump down to the chest containing '''''[[Apple Gel]] x3'''''. To '''East Beach'''.

Up the cliff and take the south way around to a '''''[[Blue Rosemary]]'''''. Jump down the following two cliffs and check next to the water for '''''[[Paladin's Cape]]'''''.

In the '''East Region''', take '''''[[Black Egg]] x3''''' out of the residence, then enter the Mayor's House for a scene and to complete [[In Dreams (Part 1)]].

You should have a Rebirth Doll from the Zenethra. If you feel like you're going to die, equip it. Black Onyx can also be used if you get snagged in a combo, but it's less reliable since it only increases your HP.

She capable of many status ailments, so use Syrup Bottles or an Amulet. If you back off of her, she'll attempt to attack you from underground or cast a wind/dark/fire spell. The Four, naturally, are good attacks to use once you start staggering her, as well as any light attacks you have (Drache used Divine Streak; do spam it if you're in a tight spot, it's wonderful). The best way to handle her is hit and run... or guard, but be careful, as she can break it fairly easily. She can throw you, regardless of whether you're guarding, and she can attack in all directions. Once she overlimits, she'll spam long range magic suddenly... Block the stuff that follows you, if you can't run from it in time, and run away from any spells. Her Mystic Arte will reduce you to 1 HP. Avoid the black ball; it holds you in place. The black things on the ground also draw you to them, so stay far away.

The major problem with her is that a couple combos may be enough to kill you. The easiest times to attack her are after she tries her underground stabby attack, when she taunts you, and when she passes through you. If you're close enough, you should be able to nail her before she casts a spell too. You can also try knocking her down with a Flare Bomb if you need a short breather.

Coming from Jude's side, a scene will happen a little into the battle, then another after his Mystic Arte, and yet another after a second one! Theeeennnn the party really starts. And the butthole's HP is reset.

He's a little hard to knock down and has big attacks. You'll notice Maxwell uses variations of attacks Milla has, so you should generally know what his attacks do; knockdown from fire, hold in place with darkness, and so on. The biggest problem is that the jerkface steals your TP, so you may want to use Treats. His Mystic Arte will hit the entire party, but it isn't devastating (especially with all elemental resistances up).  He's really not that difficult and should go down fairly easily.

The great thing about Milla is that she hits about every weakness, making her great for this battle... not to mention the Four are quite broken, if costly.

This boss likes to bounce and roll around the field, zap all around himself, and zap whoever is in front of him. He's shockingly easy, pun intended. Even when he starts going all out or in overlimit, he's not at all hard.

How to make this battle hilariously easy: Equip Elemental Guard (resists Fire/Water/Earth/Wind) and Dragon Helm (resists Fire) or find a good equivalent. Then combine with Fire/Wind Guard skills. You will ABSORB most of Volts attacks.

Near a few trees by the opposite wall is '''''[[Meadow Crystal]] x6'''''. There is a boss monster near here; you'll be directed to it shortly.

Enter the '''Tatalian Abyss''' exit to create a shortcut. We'll direct you there after some plot. Instead, head to the northeast exit to the '''Dimensional Breach'''.

Skit obsessed? Don't beat Dranzort at Tatalian Abyss till you've beaten any other Devil's Beast (except Melanbron). There are two versions of the skit: one for Jude, one for Milla.

Yeah, nothing to do here for now.

At '''Trigleph''', return to the client at the port to finish [[Hunt Down The Shadow Stalkers]] and go to room 303 of the apartments for [[The Otherworld Reactor Plan]]. Then rest at Balan's for a long chatty scene; you get '''''[[Muzet's Knife]]''''' afterward. Head to the west wing of the apartment building for the final part of [[Rumors of Elympios]].

Now head back to the '''Dimensional Breach''' and enter the Crossroads.

Once you've reached Riese Maxia, it's time for an optional dungeon.

|* Some Aifread's Treasures |

If you're on Milla's Path, return to the Hallowmont for some Aifread's Treasures. Up the first cliff at the '''Trailhead''' behind the first rock you see, is '''''[[Angel Wings]]'''''. At the halfway point, in a hole at the top of all the cliffs, and next to a chest containing a Creamy Beef Bowl (Small), is '''''[[Dark Seal]]'''''.

If you want a full walkthrough for all the chests in the area, click [[Nia Khera Hallowmont (Jude)]] and just ignore the plot stuff. The monsters there are also different from those that appeared in the Spirit Realm.

Approach the Mathis Clinic for the second part of [[Jude's Substitute]]. Warp to the '''Felgana Mine''' and go to the southwest corner of Shaft 4 to complete the event. Then, as the skit suggests, turn around and head in the Mathis Clinic for [[The Aspyrixis]]. Head to the '''Old Vicalle Mine''' now; the boy is at the North Region.

You can fight the Devil's Beast Roparde while you're in the Mine, but it has a quirk -- it summons four Fili-type monsters representing each element. Which he summons depends on what his elemental strength is at the time he calls for help, so let use Barrier Change every so often (and hit him with his weakness to trigger it? Maybe?). You want to see all of them for your enemy data; be soft on him till he summons all four.

After saving the boy, check the counter by the Food Vendor for the final part of [[Memories of Leronde]].

At Talim Medical School - Reception is a guy (Eldin) you can talk to for the third part of [[Those Who Act in Shadow]] (Milla only; for Jude, you should have done this a while ago). Go to Reception Room 5 for the final part of [[Leia's Failure]]. For a Jude exclusive sidequest, go to the Teaching Wing of the school to bump into [[Professor Haus' Research]].

At the Central Plaza is the researcher you can talk to for the final part of [[The Shape of Our World]]. At the Lord's Manor Gates, approach the manor to start [[Take Over Fort Gandala]]. If you've given the Jet Black Feather guy over 400 feathers, the next time you attempt to give him feathers (at 459 feathers or more), he won't be there. Head to Culmar Trail's southeast tip to find him... and a fight.  This finishes [[Jet Black Feathers]].

As for [[Pretty and Pink]]? You need to go to [[Tatalian Abyss]] for that. Be sure to read the end of this section, about the Devil's Beasts, before going there.

Teehee. The soldier is voiced by a dude, when she's definitely a dudette.

If you are missing any Fort Gandala enemies, get them BEFORE fighting the Golems; all monsters will leave afterward.

From the Talys Highroad exit, enter the north door you see within the Fort to arrive at 1F. The first door is your destination, Control Room 02. Now you can head into the Central Passage to beat up the Golems. You will be fighting four of them, but two at a time.

If you are on Milla's Path, you can explore the area for treasures you didn't get from the other side of the fort. See [[Fort Gandala (Jude)]] for more info (just ignore the scripted fights and such). Keep in mind that section starts from Talys Highroad side. If you just want the Aifread's Treasure, head through the Central Passage and check just in front of the southwest statue.

On Jude's path, you can see [[Fort Gandala (Milla)]] for the treasures from the other side. To get to where that section starts head to the south side of the Fort and take the elevator to 2F. The cell that section starts in will be the west room from there.

There's really no incentive to open the chests,

After all that, head back to the Manor in Sharilton to talk to Driselle and complete [[Take Over Fort Gandala]].

On the west side of the bridge, up the northern elevator, is [[The Cause of Shifting Spirit Climes]]. Head to Alvin's mother's place, then follow Isla to the Labari Hollow's bridge (the game lied!) to complete [[Mother and Child]].

After all that, head toward the wyvern cage for [[Homing Instinct]].

Then go to Labari Hollow again, as prompted by the skit, to start [[What Lies in Memory]]. Stick around long enough a new skit to pop up. To finish it, go to Mon Highlands - North Branch, the area beyond Silent Cave to complete it.

+

At '''Trigleph''', STOP. Get the first skit listed, and you might as well get the second as well. You can move now.

There is an automatic scene in the Commercial District, which is part of [[Love-Fevered Visions]]. Head to 3F of Rodo Apartments for the final part of [[Sisterhood]], then talk to Balan for [[Balan's Bet]]. At '''Rusalle Highroad - North Region''', pretty much in the middle of the path between all exits, is a golden/sparkly patch of plants to inspect. After the fight, return to Balan.

From the Torbalan entrance of '''Helioborg Fortress''', head inside the building for [[The Origin of Spyrite]]. While you're here, you can fight the Devil's Beast, Melanbron, on the roof where you fought Volt... but if you're skit obsessed, don't do it unless you've killed Roparde, Gartrega, Schweiss, or Folzam first.

Now back to Driselle in '''Sharilton''' for the final part of [[Love-Fevered Visions]].

|* Devil's Beasts |

*NEW SKITS AVAILABLE:

=--Note...--=
If you have trouble with the boss monsters, go to [[Tatalian Abyss]] and level up a little, as well as get your shop levels up.

If you are skit obsessed, you will miss a skit if you fight Dranzort (the Tatalian Abyss monster) or Melanbron first.

|* Mysterious Jewel Bosses |

Now you should kill those two boss monsters you may have passed by in Elympios -- they drop Mysterious Jewels.

* [[Veywind Eye]]
** Go to '''Torbalan Highroad - Central Region'''.
** He likes to stun you and he can petrify you so BEWARE.
+
* [[Graddic Claw]]
** Located at '''Rasalle Highroad - Tatalian Abyss Entrance'''.

|* Kanbalar |

Head toward the castle for [[Gaius, the King]]. You can also talk to Wingul for [[The Two Generals]], if you didn't do it in Chapter 3.

Seriously, do [[Tatalian Abyss]] right now if you haven't. Otherwise you're not getting far in the coming sub event.

At Xailen Woods Temple, head inside the building and continue forward for a scene. The Mysterious Jewels you've been collecting DO have a purpose -- give it all the jewels you have (you should have all 23 now!). This is for [[The Lost Transcendental Ring]].

Immediately after giving it all 23 Jewels, you're launched into an easy boss fight against [[Crimson Servant]] and [[Azure Servant]]. (Make 'em even easier? Equip a Blue Cape. You'll absorb all the darkness attacks.) You get '''''[[Arte Tome: "One-Hit Kill"]]''''' for the trouble.

You can find Pink Emeralds here to finally complete [[Pretty and Pink]]. At long last, Elize can be a Pro Pinkist.

You may also find Gold Bacuras here.

=--Note...--=
This place is pretty good for grinding up shop levels. There are a lot of good materials to gather here, like [[Pink Emerald]] and [[Dingy Puffball]]. But more importantly, the enemies have good items. Blade Beaks drop [[Pheasant Tail]], and it's their stealable item as well. They're by far the best enemy to fight for materials. Twilight Sentinels drop [[Libavius Ore]] (like the Goblins do), but more importantly, you can steal [[Dragon Ash]] from them.
=-=

Take the southwest path to '''''[[Magical Ore]] x7''''', then follow the main path to a scene. This is part of [[The Gathering Miasma]]. Before proceeding, check the north point of the area behind you for '''''[[Copper Ore]] x20'''''. Jump down the cliff and turn around to find '''''[[Creepy Antenna]] x6'''''. Continue toward the floaty object for a scene. As it suggests, jump!

|* B1F |

Head toward the wind seal, then to the northwest region for '''''[[Ancient Coral]] x8''''' on a small cliff. In the area west of there is '''''[[Sapphire Shell]] x5'''''.

Now go to the southeast wing, and take the north path. Behind a few boxes on the west wall is an Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Superhero Belt]]'''''. Continue northwest for a ladder; climb it, take the '''''[[Hair of the Sacred Beast]] x5''''', and jump on the earth seal from the nearby cliff.

|* B2F |

Take the northeast path and climb up the cliffs to a '''''[[Red Sage]]''''', and further along the path, take the southeast fork to break the wind seal. Head back to the main path, and climb up the nearby cliff. From there, go up a series of small cliffs to the northeast to find '''''[[Strange Core]] x2'''''. You are now in the same area as the earth seal; drop down to ground level and climb the northern cliffs to stomp on the earth seal.

|* B3F |

Take the northwest path, then the northeast branch to the wind seal and '''''[[10000 gald]]'''''. When you crawl back out of that area, Aifread's Treasure, '''''[[Mysterious Jewel]]''''', should be directly ahead of you.

You should have all 61 Treasures now. If you fought Veywind Eye and Graddic Claw, you should have 23 Mysterious Jewels. Otherwise, 21.

Head back to the entrance and take the southeast path to '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x10''''' in the easternmost point, then climb the cliffs to the northwest for '''''[[Dragon Ash]] x3'''''. Jump down to smash the earth seal. From the entrance, take the northwest path and the northwest branch to arrive near a cliff you can climb up for '''''[[Blue Sephira]]'''''.

|* Depths |

Claim the '''''[[Omega Elixir]]''''' and proceed... to Dranzort, a Devil's Beast. Drache was around level 63 for this fight. Just keep him out of the range of your healer(s), guard when you see the attack coming (they're big and slow), maybe take Alvin since he can take a hit, and you'll be fine. You'll get '''''[[Dranduo, the Howling Beast]]''''', for your trouble.

If you have any unfinished sub events ([[Pretty and Pink]], [[The Lost Transcendental Ring]], [[The Devil's Beasts]]), remember to finish them.

He's lightning fast, making him a pain to combo (and to keep off your healer/caster), and he breaks out of combos easier than before. His favorite getaway attack is Rising Phoenix, and he's also quite fond of Severing Wind to make you back off.

Unlike his counterpart, Gaius packs a punch. He's quite fond of knockdown attacks, and his combos are pretty likely to kill you. Knock him down if you need to heal up. If you equip a Red Cape,  you'll be immune to his light based attacks. Snap Pivot is your very best friend.

When he approaches the halfway point, he'll get SUPER CHEAP with Swallow Fury. But you can survive it, and he won't spam it all the time.

You wind up next to '''''[[Syrup Bottle]] x2'''''. Jump down the blue, then the next two you see, then up the red. You'll come to '''''[[Lemon Gel]] x4''''' and '''''[[Pineapple Gel]] x2''''' in the same chest. Down the blue for an '''''[[Omega Elixir]]''''' right next to you, and '''''[[Life Bottle]] x3''''' further down the path. Jump into the blue light... for Gaius to finally find an excuse to rip his shirt off! YES.

Together, they'll mow you over; rely on your cheapest tactics possible -- running! Gradually, your party will rejoin and use their Mystic Artes. Just focus on surviving till you get a full party.

Like for other bosses, you can abuse elemental resistances. Start out with Amethyst, Elemental, Diamond, and such, as well as your best armor that resists either Light/Dark. Don't pull out Red/Blue Cape till one of them is gone. Beware: Muzet casts Sunburst.

Note that Muzet's health is a LOT lower. But it's hard to beat her down; she'll auto-revive once in the battle, and that's if she doesn't otherwise heal up first. Apparently she heals when she guards, so make sure to break it using Beast or something. Consider using an Hourglass if you have too much trouble with her. Otherwise, Muzet's not really all that different from the other times you fought her; she's more tedious than difficult.

Do not beat Gaius first; Muzet can revive him to half health. Put EVERYTHING into taking Muzet down.

One thing they're capable of is stopping time (like an Hourglass), then pummeling you. Do your best to not get right between them; they'll rip you apart. Gaius is good at shredding, but he's actually not too bad till he gets super-fast at the halfway point. At this point, Elize should have Revive and Leia should have good item skills, so use them both as necessary.

Oh yes. Do STEAL from both of them so they can't use their items. Muzet is particularly obnoxious with Treat spamming.

On Milla's path, you get '''''[[Spirit Garb (Milla)]]''''' and '''''[[Spirit Hairstyle (Milla)]]'''''.

On Jude's, you get '''''[[Medical Outfit (Jude)]]'''''.

For both, you receive '''''[[Arte Tome: "Tremorous Fist"]]''''', '''''[[Arte Tome: "Spirit Surge"]]''''', and '''''[[Golden Key]]'''''.

If you use the Arcane Artes you got from those tomes, Milla and Jude can use their dual Mystic Arte, Tiger Blade Sigma.

Since you have the Golden Key, you can now head to the bonus dungeon, [[Magnus Zero]]. Enter '''Fezebel Marsh''' from the Arklund Quag entrance and head all the way in. This starts [[The Golden Mage Knight]].

Every five levels, there's an blue orb general shop (everything but an item shop), exit column of light, and Memory Ring. There are treasures here, and they aren't randomized. They're nice to pick up, and some hold equipment, but ultimately you can get the items elsewhere. Still, this place is great for material grinding.

Seriously, Leia should be your best friend here for stealing, and be sure to gather a lot.

If you want to know what Drache did... she had her typical boss beating party up, which was like this:

* Milla - Good to have linked to Jude. Otherwise can be replaced by Alvin.
* Jude - Linked to Milla for all the Linked Artes and Tiger Blade Sigma. He's a generally good link partner and distraction if you need one.
* Leia - Heal/First Aid disabled. She's a good distraction for one of the Knights Can generally be replaced with Alvin, but she works better linked to Elize than the melee characters do.
* Elize - Pixie Circle/Recover/Healing Circle disabled. Largely used for Nurse and Revive, very occasional dark magic.
* Rowen - Whenever the occasion popped up that he could be used without being destroyed by one of the Mage Knights. Usually quickly switched out for Leia.

It also took her half an hour at level 70-75. Longer on Unknown in the low 80's, but she decided to goof off at the end and experiment with weaknesses just for all of you.

...Still need help? Very well, here is the most game-breaking advice possible. Here's the equipment you should have... for anyone except Alvin:

* ''Headgear:'' [[Elemental Circlet]] (Ladies) / [[Wizard's Hat]] or [[Divine Miter]] (Jude) / [[Tactician's Hat]] (Rowen)
* ''Armor:'' [[Elemental Guard]] / [[Shining Coat]] (Milla) / [[Tactician's Coat]] (Rowen) / [[Rose Dress]] or [[Elemental Cloak]] (Elize)
* ''Accessory:'' [[Elemental]] (Jude) / [[Elemental Cape]] (Anyone else)

Combined with linking and all the elemental Guard skills, you will be absorbing most of what comes your way outside of physical attacks. Not quite everything, but this should cover everything but Light/Dark... which will both be weakened a lot anyway.

Alvin has a variety of equipment to work with, but not much with multiple resists. With [[Elemental]] and linking, he can have 90% resist to any element.

This guy is POWERFUL, since he's an Alvin clone. Especially if you didn't grind and you're ten levels below him! :D He can wipe out some of the weaker characters in a few hits, so beware who you take into battle. The cheap (and recommended) way is to use Elize's Revive on everyone so you don't constantly have to use resurrection spells/items. Really, you need to conserve your items for the last part of this fight.

Any fire resistance you can get is a good thing here. Even if you need to move your armor down a couple tiers. It will help. Equip Red Capes, if you need to. Phoenix Ribbon, Dragon Helm, Garnet, and so on are good alternatives when combined with other Fire resisting equipment.

Yep, that wasn't the end of it. This is one hell of a battle, isn't it? They're not as hard hitting, at least. These two link. The Conductor is the more obnoxious of the two; get him first. The other can cast, but just stuff like Sharpness. AND Heal, so be sure to Mystic Arte/Linked Arte him to oblivion before he gets the chance. Use an hourglass if you must. If they get together, Milla's spirits help a ton since they hit a wide range.

Resist Water and Earth as much as possible.

Yeeeeep. Two casters now; Puppeteer and Creator. This is going to hurt. The last one, you could have done okay in. This one? People are going to die. There's just no way around it. Milla's spirits are even better here, as they create a fine excuse to attack her over other targets.

The Puppeteer is the worst, though, as it heals and casts. Be prepared to kick its ass quickly. Once it goes down (it will be difficult due to HP fluctuations), the battle will go smoothly. Beast is effective at stopping Healing Circle.

You can take down the Creator first, if you want, but only do so if you have enough Dark resist on everyone so the Puppeteer can be totally ineffective... except for Terror and occasional healing. Otherwise, resist light instead of darkness.

Save the Scholar for last; he hits REALLY hard, and you don't need that on top of the Creator's spells.

Elements... pretty much any resistances would be useful. Puppeteer loves darkness, and the Creator likes to spam everything but water.

You can fight him twice more for higher stats... then  you can fight him as many times as you like, but his stats will remain the same. You only need to fight him once for the sub event and trophy. You get the true power of the Devil's Arms after the first fight, as well as '''''[[Skill Tome: "Indefatigable"]]'''''.

To skip the junk below, if you don't care about treasure, click [[Coliseum]].

...You aren't done collecting treasures. Magnus Zero is now bigger, and you missed a couple at the bottom half of Labari Hollow.

Exit to the south warp from Fennmont.

This time, you'll be at the bottom of Labari Hollow. Take the path all the way to the west for '''''[[Sandwich (Large)]]'''''. Jump to the bottom layer, and check the west notch for '''''[[Navi Metal]] x7''''', then look to the opposite side for '''''[[10000 gald]]'''''.

Now go to floor 20, Bermia Gorge, so you can go to more dungeon from there.

'''Sapstrath Highroad'''

: In the wall behind where you start is a hole containing '''''[[Fragrant Silver Scales]] x7'''''. On top the east cliff (along the south wall) is '''''[[10000 gald]]'''''. Climb up the opposite (north) cliff for another hole with '''''[[Life Bottle]] x3''''' inside. Take the west (higher) warp.

'''E.S.S. Zenethra'''

: Right next to you is '''''[[Persian Boots]]'''''. Take the warp.

'''Old Vicalle Mine'''

: Right behind you is '''''[[10000 gald]]'''''. In the room to the south is '''''[[Lemon Gel]] x3''''', and the room next to that has '''''[[Aquatic Jelly]] x8'''''. Take the west warp.

'''Fezebel Marsh'''

: Next to the starting place is '''''[[Pineapple Gel]] x3'''''. Take either warp.

'''Kukhar Ice Caverns'''

: Near the Memory Ring is '''''[[Omega Elixir]]'''''. Into the warp for the second fight against you-know-who.

Theeeeennn reenter the dungeon and make it aaaalllllll the way back to the Ice Caverns.

'''Talys Highroad'''

: Hug the west wall to find a hole containing '''''[[Syrup Bottle]] x3'''''. Just to the east below the cliff is a '''''[[Life Bottle]]'''''. The northern cliff has a cavity containing '''''[[10000 gald]]'''''. Finally, the central cliff has '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x11''''' and the warp you should take.

'''Fort Gandala'''

: The southeast corner has '''''[[Libavius Ore]] x8''''', and the northwest corner has '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x12'''''. Take the warp.

: ...See the bottom part? Yep, you can't get down there. This dungeon is pure evil.

'''Nia Khera Spiritway'''

: This game does not make it easy to identify places!

: Right in front of you is '''''[[Strange Core]] x10''''', just south of the northernmost cliff is '''''[[Specific Plus]] x2''''', and the northeast tip has '''''[[10000 gald]]'''''. Take either warp.

'''Felgana Mine'''

: The east tip of the area has '''''[[Jet Black Feather]] x13''''', and next to the north wall is an '''''[[Elixir]]'''''. Only one warp here.

'''Tatalian Abyss'''

Fight jerkface one more time, if you want. There's one more treasure to get.

===Coliseum===

This is not intended to be something to help you get through an Unknown run of the Coliseum. The fact is, you should be comfortable with a character if you're going to do things "legit".

Turn the difficulty down to Easy; these are simply easy ways to get you through the solo matches, both the Advanced Single and the Grand Master fights. Try to be over level 70, at least.

* ''Jude''
** Shattering Demon Fist is good for hitting a crowd, and Demon Fist is good from a distance. Whirlwind Snap is also fun to spam. It's not as powerful as Shattering Demon Fist, but it doesn't knock the enemy down.
+
* ''Milla''
** Gnome is decent when surrounded, Undine can be used from a distance, and Efreet is just great. If you have the ability to cast in air, then Sunburst everything to oblivion.
+
* ''Alvin''
** Arc Fire and Pulse Shot. Very cheap, but very effective. If you really want to turn your brain off, switch to semi auto and spam Variable Trigger.
+
* ''Elize''
** Teepo Roar for anything stopping you from casting, Negative Gate for everything else. Equip a [[Mystic Emblem]].
+
* ''Rowen''
** Tidal Wave, and Fireball for anyone too fast (Jude or Ivar). Equip a [[Mystic Emblem]] or his Speed Cast skill. For Jude, don't be afraid to use an Hourglass to give you time to cast.
+
* ''Leia''
** Crescent Flash for hitting a crowd. Occasionally Staff Rain, and Darting Claw. Just use whatever sticks for you; she's a little difficult to get used to. Equip Bonus Extension 2 so you can Flash Guard for Elongated Staff.

+
+
+

''Grinding to Level 99''

=-----=

The following information is from Xavalia of GFAQs. It's amazingly effective.

Equip [[Demon Seal]]s on everyone but Rowen, who should have a [[Dark Seal]].

When you go into the Coliseum, your party is "hidden", but is still "participating" in battle. So anyone who is "on the field" will get bonus experience from coliseum fights and everyone else will level up normally as well.

With no experience multipliers, and using [[Spicy Chicken Roll (Large)]], you can get 30,000 experience per each Advanced Singles fight. Each fight lasts about 40 seconds, so it goes much more quickly than any other grinding method.

To make fights go quickly, spam Tidal Wave, preferably with Speed Cast and Grace equipped. That's it. If you don't have his Grace skill yet, you can either try to Fireball Ivar's face off, and/or you can taunt with the Charismatic Stance skill equipped. Neither of them are quite as effective as the Grace skill, but they can get you through.

===Odds and Ends (Trophy Hunting)===

First of all, scroll through [[Etc. Skits]] to see if you missed anything, aside from gameplay-related skits.

In the event that you don't have some Titles/Trophies related to gameplay, there are some simple tricks you can do. Not all of them are super-fast, sorry.

''Infinite Combo''

=-----=

* ''Milla''
** No linking, set all characters to manual.
** Push enemy against wall, spam Sylph
** Equip [[Risk Ring]], or use Gels when she runs out of TP.
** Minimum Damage skill
** Hilariously easy.

Mega thanks to myfavoritetvsho of GFAQs for pointing out this trick.

+
* ''Spirit Shift''
** Just spam Flare Bomb, Wind Blade, etc. like crazy.
** Skills: Minimum Damage
+
* ''Charge''
** Like Spirit Shift, spam whatever technique you like and hold CIRCLE to charge up each time.
** Skills: Minimum Damage, Speed Charge
+
* ''Teepo Switch''
** Keep hitting L3.
** Recommended Enemy: [[Tortoise]]. It's slow.
** Skills: Do NOT equip Morale Support.
+
* ''Arte Tuning''
** Try pressing O to Wind Lance or Rock Trine. Something quick and easy.
** Skills: Minimum Damage
+
* ''Elongating Staff''
** Even though you are supposed to backstep, Leia's not as good at it as Jude. Instead, Flash Guard. You do not have to wait for the staff to disappear.
** Recommended Enemy: [[Axe Beak]]
** Skills: Flash Guard, Bonus Extension 2

''AI Skills''

=-----=
* ''Restore''
** [[Cave Plant]] is wonderful. Just walk up to 'em and stand there like a dummy. Switch to Manual control; Semi-Auto makes you auto guard.
+
* ''Bind''
** Be Elize. Pow Hammer stuns, which makes binding extra easy. Probably do it on a Speed type enemy, such as [[Fleet Mare]] to make it easy, but it will work on anything you can stun consistently.
** Skills: Minimum Damage
+
* ''Breaker''
** Find a Guard type enemy, such as a Golem type enemy and turn off all Alvin's artes. Go sort of easy on them to give them a lot of opportunities to block.
** Skills: Minimum Damage
+
* ''Teepo Drain''
** Find a Technical Type enemy, for instance, [[Leafy Mandragora]], and turn off all Elize's artes. She'll drain a lot. She'll drain even more if you can effectively combo in the air. Try spamming Cloud Pierce or something similar. Whatever you do, spam something that costs a good chunk of TP.
** Skills: Minimum Damage
+
* ''Auto Magic Guard''
** Try entering a battle full of Channelers, such as [[Insurgent Channeler]]. Goblin enemies may work as well. As long as you don't move, your AI ally won't either!
+
* ''Item Steal''
** Try to target Gentleman type enemies. They drop [[Dingy Puffball]], which is good for the shops. Otherwise, just pick any enemy that has a stealable item and knock 'em down with your arte of choice.

==New Game+ / Grade Shop==

Upon completion of the game, you can save clear data that will allow you to start a new game with bonuses, depending on how many titles you earned during your last playthrough. Each title earned you a set amount of points to use in the Grade Shop! Here's what can be purchased using those points upon starting New Game+.

For most titles, your progress carries on to the next playthrough. So if you still need 800 encounters, for instance, you won't have to start again from zero.

''Part 1:'' This part is for Jude only, leading to it being a two part battle. This first battle you're meant to lose, so go ahead and let her take you out (unless you want a lengthy, meaningless challenge.) The second part of the battle is fought by both regardless of who you're controlling.

''Part 2:'' Milla is super overpowered. Unless you're on a harder difficulty, even if Red staggers you a lot, there shouldn't be a problem mopping the floor with her. If you're not already controlling her, just use L1 and her directional button to take control of her, then spam Sylph or Undine using LEFT STICK + UP (or + RIGHT) to wipe her out. Hopefully you're quick enough and Jude wins some EXP as well.

This boss comes attached to a tutorial about linked artes. You might as well try chaining on this boss, as he isn't particularly difficult at the beginning. His movements start slow enough that you can tell, most of the time, when to guard. He does have two attacks he'll start spamming that both hit a wide circular range; you'd better run if he starts it. He'll thrust his antennas into the ground when he activates either of them; the difference between them is that one attack follows its target (probably you), and the other is short range.

To deal some decent damage, control Milla and use her Fireball in conjunction with either Alvin's Tiger Blade to land Hell Pyre, or Jude's Soaring Vortex for Aerial Fire. (If you have Jude's Steel and Milla's Flame Ring, then that does even more damage, though it's a bit harder to get Jude to cooperate.) Link with Alvin on occasion when he's needed to break the Demon's guard, and use Jude for normal attacks when Milla's TP runs low and he's not needed for healing. Depending on the difficulty, if you don't like playing healer, it's worth it to take control of Milla, since you'll likely be healing more often than not.

One of the cute things about ailments in this game is that if your linked partner gets one, you get one too. So watch out for weak. Oh, and don't be a dummy like Drache was. Upgrade your equipment. ;)

He comes with two small fry. Be sure to get rid of them quickly so the whole party is focused on the big guy. If Jiao is chasing you, by all means ignore them. He hits like a truck. He's just slow enough to guard when he brings his hammer down to blast the area around him. You'll want to keep Elize's TP up so she can heal.

Definitely control Milla in this fight, as Jude's Soaring Vortex takes too long and keeps you open for damage. Link with him though, as tossing in an extra Final Gale and / or Aerial Fire definitely helps. Do your best to hit him with Milla's wind attacks, as they may actually stagger him. His attacks get heavier as you whittle down his HP, and they tend to either stun or knock you down. He will also summon a [[Hawk]] at some point, as well as another [[Sylvan Wolf]] or two. At this point, it's best to keep Jiao's attention yourself; otherwise he'll beat up the *rest* of your party.

In the event you have access to Fairy Circle (Milla/Elize), don't cast it too close to him unless you want to get stunned after casting. Hammer Rain is pretty good, though.

Consider using Syrup Bottles; they have limited times, but prevent ailments. This guy will inflict a bunch of 'em with mist attacks -- Arteseal, Poison, and Skillseal. He also has wide range, hard hitting attacks (one stuns!), so try to keep him away from Elize if you have her out. Consider giving her (or everyone, depending on how many you have) the Seal Ward so she can keep healing and using artes, and someone else should have the Stun Bracelet on (likely Jude, so he's always dealing damage). He can cast both a bell attack (it can confuse, but this is a larger problem on higher difficulties) or a wind attack, so be sure to stay on him and consider linking to Rowen when you see it coming.

Your best bet is using Igneous Crush (Jude's Cerberus Strike / Milla's & Rowen's Rock Trine) and chaining from there if you're lucky, getting as many in as you can per set of Linked Artes. While it is weak to Earth, Rock Trine on its own will miss most of the time, making it practically useless. You can also spam Fireball (with extra Fireballs) with Rowen from a distance, if you're having trouble.

If you have access to Recovery Heal (Jude's Recovery Ring / Elize's Recover), that would be quite lovely to use this battle, as it acts like a massive Syrup Bottle AND Panacea Bottle. Pixie Heal (Jude's Healer / Elize's Pixie Heal) also works quite nicely for mass HP recovery.

If you're used to Milla (Drache was!), this is really awkward, but can be done. Aqua Sweep will knock him down and give you time to recover, just make sure to run away from him first. His combos are pretty damaging, and the main problem to anyone not used to Jude is healing. Don't use Healer; Ivar's too fast for that. He'll also Seal your artes, get behind you, and break your guard. Seal Ward isn't a bad item! Keep dodging his combos, and try to free run and bait him into attacking air. He will attack faster than you; don't try to out speed him. Demon Fist can be used from a distance, but don't overdo it.

Jude's Snap Pivot, activated by backstepping away from an enemy's attack, is actually quite a nice ability as it gets him behind the enemy. It makes things a looooot easier. If you don't have it mastered, the battle is simple enough that it can be done without, but it will be harder.

This one has a spray attack and burrows underground to attack, but isn't particularly fast or hard hitting. However, when you get his HP down to a certain point, he does have a fairly fast underground attack that keeps following you; backstep from it. Jude has a variety of good linked artes with Leia, but Pixie Heal is particularly useful. Annoyingly, this guy will summon Worm Shades. Don't divert your attention to them; big guy will cause you more problems than a spell every so often. On higher difficulties, Arteseal is an annoyance.

It would not be a bad idea to knock him down (and again in the next battle!) for that stealable item.

Those items he just dropped should come in handy.

He hits harder this time, and has more than double the HP. Not to mention he inflicts Arteseal! Have someone equip Seal Charm, and everyone else can have a Seal Ward. Don't link with Leia except for stealing and the very occasional linked arte; she'll back off and heal if she isn't attached to you, and the battle will go more smoothly. The major thing to watch out for is that he sometimes lunges forward, instead of up, when underground. He also likes to stun a lot and even grab you like the smaller worms. Toward the end, he'll get ridiculously fast with going underground, then he'll start causing rocks to fall. And yes, he'll summon a worm again.

Be careful to not get trapped against the edge, or in front of his charge; if you aren't guarding, you'll probably die. One of the more annoying things he does is summon the local monsters to assist him. If you have subpar equipment, he's absolutely going to kill you. Even with the best you can get, he hits incredibly hard, so block or die. There's no fast or easy way; bring a lot of items. He's also capable of stunning and inflicting Linkseal, as well as digging underground to attack you (backstep away from that one). As he dies, he'll rampage around and call a bunch of enemies. Obnoxious, but can be dealt with.

This is, honestly, very easy, even on unknown. Pick a boss whose weakness you have access to and take 'em down. Keep in mind, if you don't steal their items they're capable of using the Gels they have.

Presa is capable of throwing stuff at you (it stuns!) and casting artes. Stay on her; the AI cannot be relied upon to prevent her from casting artes, so they're better off occupying Wingul. Avoid getting close to both of them; one will shred you while the other will use that time to cast artes. It's impossible to leave the trap once in it. Separate, they're easy. Together, you're probably dead. And they will come together, like your own AI allies do, to protect each other, so you're just going to have to find a way to survive during those moments.

On higher difficulties, they may confuse you. Definitely the most obnoxious of ailments. Wingul also tends to like casting Arrivederci and Flame Ring. His spells are much less deadly than Presa's; they're more of an annoyance.

A very mobile boss; hard to keep hitting. Obnoxiously, it spins to attack a very wide range which can keep staggering you, over and over. It's possible to get inside the attack radius so he can't hit you, though. It can also inflict you with Curse with its beam of darkness attack, along with Paralysis from another attack. Elize's Dispel is invaluable (if you don't have it, use the Jude/Elize Recover Heal). Since it's weak to water, Rowen isn't a bad choice for his Splash and Blue Sphere, as well as for Spash Beam (Rowen/Jude). Later in the fight, it starts to use fireballs and whirlwinds.

Overall, not a difficult boss. Just hard to keep in one place except with knockdown attacks.

Strangely low stats, for a boss, and she has an odd obsession with using Lemon Gels (steal it to make her stop).

But! She'll throw the first Mystic Arte of the game on you, which will harm the entire party (maybe even kill someone, if you're unlucky). Don't be afraid to use a Treat after it... and bring out Elize, if you haven't, so she can Dispel and protect against Burn. If you see her overlimit, run. Your linked partner will follow you, at least, and she'll hopefully chase you through her entire overlimit instead of unleashing a Mystic Arte. The reason for this is because, to unleash a Mystic Arte, an Arcane Arte must connect with its target first. This applies to both you and the enemy.

As she dies, she'll spam a fire attack that hits a small area around her; it's hard to get a hit in if you stay too close to her. Mystic Arte aside, she's generally a pushover.

You have a Dark Cape from this very dungeon; equip it on whoever you think needs it the most. Also, you can steal an Amethyst from him, which you ought to equip immediately. He really likes darkness.

One of the things he likes to do is impale and toss you to the ground. He's also capable of cursing you, so, like always, Elize is a good idea. It's also a good idea to have at least one caster in the back, that way your party isn't taken out all at once.

At times, he'll change his blade to one emanating darkness, and his attacks will pack more of a punch. Then, when he's in overlimit, he'll try spamming Tyrant Spear to try and hit you with his Mystic Arte. STAY. BACK. Luckily, this doesn't hit everyone; just whoever happens to be in reach -- but beware, if everyone is in front of him, they're all as good as dead. (Drache only had Leia survive once. Guess who had the Amethyst equipped.) If everyone gets bunched together, RUN. That should get your linked partner to follow you, at least, which will spare part of your team from potential annihilation. Make sure to set the strategies to keep your frail allies away.

He can cast some artes; if you're ready for them, you can simply run out of their range. He can also stab his sword into the ground; while that attack can follow you, it's fairly easy to also run away from.

Finally, a true three on four battle. Don't overuse casters; you want one caster (probably Elize for healing) and three people to be (mostly) bait. The problem with casters is that they'll probably be targeted in the middle of casting, making them useless. Focus on Jiao; he's definitely the most dangerous and the most obnoxious. He is capable of healing, somehow, so you'll need to seriously use your best wind attacks toward the end.

Note that these people can link. When one overlimits, the other can Mystic Arte away, so try to stay on the unlinked one and let the AI get murdered instead. And if one overlimits alone... again, let the AI be murdered. Fairy Circle (Milla/Elize and Milla/Leia) is actually quite helpful, as it whittles down Jiao's health and keeps up your own. But you're stuck in place, so beware using it.

The worst part? They can confuse you. Try to keep Dispel up. (That arte is simply divine. Elize is always welcome to the party.)

Try to spam your own Mystic Artes in this battle; you need to be in overlimit, then use an Arcane Arte (you probably only have a few, at this point) and holds X. They're increasingly going to go into Overlimit as they die; be patient, don't rush, and you can survive the Mystic Arte hell.

...And now a light based boss with a crap ton of attack. He has some lovely beam attacks, as well as one that wraps around him. He also likes Beast, which knocks you down, and multi-hit sword attacks. Like other bosses, he'll use Mystic Artes, and thus you should RUUUUN when he overlimits. He only hits the people in range, but it will kill whoever gets caught. As he dies, his attacks get crazier, and he starts to confuse you (jerk!).

Be patient; guard when you have to, try to only use life bottles for your main and best healer, and only approach when it's relatively safe. This battle is something of a slog, or maybe even a war of attrition, but only because he hits hard.

It'd be a good idea to equip a Stun Bracelet or Talisman.

They can link. Alvin/Jude should link to take out one of the dragons. If one of them starts to harass Elize too much, link with her and start smacking the other dragon till you feel safe unlinking again. Due to the dragons linking, this shouldn't be a huge problem; they'll both pick the same target eventually. The biggest problem is when you get stuck between the two; you're otherwise going to be okay with their damage output.

Very obnoxiously, the dragons can heal. You'll just have to muscle your way through that, as far as Drache can tell.

He likes to spin around and knock you down, and he summons monsters. All of his attacks are big enough to hit you a backstep away, but that's his biggest quirk. Quite the step down from Gaius, huh? He's not very threatening, even when he steps up the attacks as he dies.

Focus on Gilland first to get him out of the way (though Celsius will protect him at times, so beware). He has a very damaging beam attack that will probably wipe you out if you wind up in right front of it.

Celsius naturally has a variety of ice attacks; one surrounds her to knock you over, and she likes to follow that up with an attack exclusively for downed allies. She also inflicts a bunch of status effects.

They can also perform linked arts, which hit like a truck. Despite all that, they're not difficult so long as you focus on Gilland. Celsius has an Aquamarine to steal/equip, if you don't have one already.

You can equip a Reverse Doll, which you should have gotten in the previous dungeon. Alternatively, there's Black Onyx, Amulet (burn sucks), or Stun Talisman. Black Onyx is probably the least useful, but it can help you out of a pinch. Alternatively, you can try Stun Bracelet and Syrup Bottle together, and only equip the Reverse Doll or Black Onyx when you get caught in a combo or a tough spot.

Be warned -- he hits like a TRUCK. You will need to abuse free run and snap pivot if you want to survive. Try to free run around shots (if you see them coming) and snap pivot his sword swings. You can also approach him after he finishes attacking, but be careful. Use a knockdown attack, such as Beast, if you need to heal up. Ideally, don't get hit. Seriously, one of his combos can bring you down. Do use Steel; every bit of attack will help.

Toward the end, he'll heal himself using Guardian Field. Once he starts pulling that, consider spamming Demon Fist to prevent him from getting a full heal out of it.

You'll want Leia and Jude (or just Jude!) up front, so Rowen and Elize can hang back and do what they do best.

Muzet hits pretty hard, including behind her, so you will take quite the beating. You should be a little patient when approaching her, or else don't constantly link with a partner so they don't keep trying (and failing) to match your movements.

She also looooves ailments, so keep Dispel up. Her darkness spells tend to hold you in place or draw you in, so do your best to stay clear of those.

Once she overlimits, she'll spam long range magic suddenly... Block the stuff that follows you, if you can't run around it in time, and run away from any spells. One of your allies is sure to be dumb enough to get hit by her Mystic Arte, so keep your health way up, and use whatever you need to survive.

This time, Ivar actually packs a punch. And the jerk confuses you. This battle is obnoxious because it's hard to occupy both the wyvern and Ivar. Since Ivar is fast, you should handle him first. The wyvern might hit you from time to time, or kill Rowen, but he's not particularly threatening.

Ivar's Mystic Arte will reduce to 1 HP, but it hits multiple targets in his range... which can be everyone, if you're unlucky.

Take out Agria first. Why? Presa heals, so you'll need to focus a lot of attention on her to actually *kill* the woman. The Fire Djinns alone will divert attention away from Presa.

Other than the constant Mystic Arte spamming, this battle isn't that bad.

You should have a Rebirth Doll from the Zenethra. If you feel like you're going to die, equip it. Black Onyx can also be used if you get snagged in a combo, but it's less reliable since it only increases your HP.

She capable of many status ailments, so use Syrup Bottles or an Amulet. If you back off of her, she'll attempt to attack you from underground or cast a wind/dark/fire spell. The Four, naturally, are good attacks to use once you start staggering her, as well as any light attacks you have (Drache used Divine Streak; do spam it if you're in a tight spot, it's wonderful). The best way to handle her is hit and run... or guard, but be careful, as she can break it fairly easily. She can throw you, regardless of whether you're guarding, and she can attack in all directions. Once she overlimits, she'll spam long range magic suddenly... Block the stuff that follows you, if you can't run from it in time, and run away from any spells. Her Mystic Arte will reduce you to 1 HP. Avoid the black ball; it holds you in place. The black things on the ground also draw you to them, so stay far away.

The major problem with her is that a couple combos may be enough to kill you. The easiest times to attack her are after she tries her underground stabby attack, when she taunts you, and when she passes through you. If you're close enough, you should be able to nail her before she casts a spell too. You can also try knocking her down with a Flare Bomb if you need a short breather.

Coming from Jude's side, a scene will happen a little into the battle, then another after his Mystic Arte, and yet another after a second one! Theeeennnn the party really starts. And the butthole's HP is reset.

He's a little hard to knock down and has big attacks. You'll notice Maxwell uses variations of attacks Milla has, so you should generally know what his attacks do; knockdown from fire, hold in place with darkness, and so on. The biggest problem is that the jerkface steals your TP, so you may want to use Treats. His Mystic Arte will hit the entire party, but it isn't devastating (especially with all elemental resistances up).  He's really not that difficult and should go down fairly easily.

The great thing about Milla is that she hits about every weakness, making her great for this battle... not to mention the Four are quite broken, if costly.

This boss likes to bounce and roll around the field, zap all around himself, and zap whoever is in front of him. He's shockingly easy, pun intended. Even when he starts going all out or in overlimit, he's not at all hard.

How to make this battle hilariously easy: Equip Elemental Guard (resists Fire/Water/Earth/Wind) and Dragon Helm (resists Fire) or find a good equivalent. Then combine with Fire/Wind Guard skills. You will ABSORB most of Volts attacks.

He's lightning fast, making him a pain to combo (and to keep off your healer/caster), and he breaks out of combos easier than before. His favorite getaway attack is Rising Phoenix, and he's also quite fond of Severing Wind to make you back off. Later in the battle, he's start casting short range spells; do make sure you have Elize for this part, as the ailments start popping up.

Want to make it easy? Just equip your best wind resistant stuff.

She's nowhere neeeeaaaaar as difficult as your earlier encounter with her, and her attack patterns are largely the same. Just make sure to use the occasional item and you'll be fine.

Unlike his counterpart, Gaius packs a punch. He's quite fond of knockdown attacks, and his combos are pretty likely to kill you. Knock him down if you need to heal up. If you equip a Red Cape,  you'll be immune to his light based attacks. Snap Pivot is your very best friend.

When he approaches the halfway point, he'll get SUPER CHEAP with Swallow Fury. But you can survive it, and he won't spam it all the time.

Together, they'll mow you over; rely on your cheapest tactics possible -- running! Gradually, your party will rejoin and use their Mystic Artes. Just focus on surviving till you get a full party.

Like for other bosses, you can abuse elemental resistances. Start out with Amethyst, Elemental, Diamond, and such, as well as your best armor that resists either Light/Dark. Don't pull out Red/Blue Cape till one of them is gone. Beware: Muzet casts Sunburst.

Note that Muzet's health is a LOT lower. But it's hard to beat her down; she'll auto-revive once in the battle, and that's if she doesn't otherwise heal up first. Apparently she heals when she guards, so make sure to break it using Beast or something. Consider using an Hourglass if you have too much trouble with her. Otherwise, Muzet's not really all that different from the other times you fought her; she's more tedious than difficult.

Do not beat Gaius first; Muzet can revive him to half health. Put EVERYTHING into taking Muzet down.

One thing they're capable of is stopping time (like an Hourglass), then pummeling you. Do your best to not get right between them; they'll rip you apart. Gaius is good at shredding, but he's actually not too bad till he gets super-fast at the halfway point. At this point, Elize should have Revive and Leia should have good item skills, so use them both as necessary.

Oh yes. Do STEAL from both of them so they can't use their items. Muzet is particularly obnoxious with Treat spamming.

This guy is POWERFUL, since he's an Alvin clone. Especially if you didn't grind and you're ten levels below him! :D He can wipe out some of the weaker characters in a few hits, so beware who you take into battle. The cheap (and recommended) way is to use Elize's Revive on everyone so you don't constantly have to use resurrection spells/items. Really, you need to conserve your items for the last part of this fight.

Any fire resistance you can get is a good thing here. Even if you need to move your armor down a couple tiers. It will help. Equip Red Capes, if you need to. Phoenix Ribbon, Dragon Helm, Garnet, and so on are good alternatives when combined with other Fire resisting equipment.

Yep, that wasn't the end of it. This is one hell of a battle, isn't it? They're not as hard hitting, at least. These two link. The Conductor is the more obnoxious of the two; get him first. The other can cast, but just stuff like Sharpness. AND Heal, so be sure to Mystic Arte/Linked Arte him to oblivion before he gets the chance. Use an hourglass if you must. If they get together, Milla's spirits help a ton since they hit a wide range.

Resist Water and Earth as much as possible.

Yeeeeep. Two casters now; Puppeteer and Creator. This is going to hurt. The last one, you could have done okay in. This one? People are going to die. There's just no way around it. Milla's spirits are even better here, as they create a fine excuse to attack her over other targets.

The Puppeteer is the worst, though, as it heals and casts. Be prepared to kick its ass quickly. Once it goes down (it will be difficult due to HP fluctuations), the battle will go smoothly. Beast is effective at stopping Healing Circle.

You can take down the Creator first, if you want, but only do so if you have enough Dark resist on everyone so the Puppeteer can be totally ineffective... except for Terror and occasional healing. Otherwise, resist light instead of darkness.

Save the Scholar for last; he hits REALLY hard, and you don't need that on top of the Creator's spells.

Elements... pretty much any resistances would be useful. Puppeteer loves darkness, and the Creator likes to spam everything but water.

==FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)==

:'''''What are the major differences between playing as Jude and Milla?'''''
*** The majority of the game is the same. However, there are quite a few differences.
**** The game starts a bit differently depending on who you choose; Jude has the ability to explore Fennmont before Milla joins.
**** A few sub events differ, in content and in deadlines. Each side also has a couple unique sub events.
**** There are points in the game where the one you choose will be separated from the other, and you'll have to go through different dungeons.
**** Each character has access to a few monsters and bosses that the other does not.
**** Each character has exclusive cut scenes that the other does not.
**** The dialogue with NPC's is different.
**** Some of the storyline is revealed a bit differently depending on the perspective.
**** Jude and Milla each have their own set of battle themes. (We like Jude's a bit better.)
+
+
:'''''What are the differences between Manual, Semi-Auto, and Auto?'''''
*** Manual gives you full control on everything, meaning you control the direction, range, and aim of your attacks/artes as well.
*** Semi-Auto helps you out and automatically changes your direction, range, and aim so that your attacks/artes can actually hit the enemy without much interaction. It also helps you automatically guard at times.
*** Auto is having your character controlled automatically by the AI, like your party members. You do nothing.
