The reality of email is that I don't respond to it often. I advise against asking me questions, as chances are I'll see them a week later or so and I
will assume you either figured it out or moved on by that point.

Feel free to leave a note if you want me to respond no matter how late I get to it. This does not guarantee response, but it makes it MUCH more likely.

=--Special Thanks--=

A super big mega you-have-no-idea thank you to ''whimsic_al''. If it's really number-y it's from him. But let's break it down:

* All the mechanics section. All of it.
* Anything that is not the description itself in the Properties and Effects sections (so all of the numbers except for those that are given and the two or three I found myself)
* WT values of everything
* Lots of ultimate item tutorials and alternate equipment builds

Did I miss anything? I hope not!

On top of that:

* afreaknamedpete - Properties research, ultimate equips
* Uryvichk - Properties research, ultimate equips, some recipes
* http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/778830-atelier-shallie-alchemists-of-the-dusk-sea/71420920
** Anyone that participated in that research thread, really. Let's never understate the importance of it.
* http://omoteura.com/atelier_shallie/ - Some miscellaneous info, primarily life tasks that I was missing.
* Setsuna - Small fix for Plus-specific Elixir

==Walkthrough==

At the beginning, you'll be introduced to both heroines, then you'll get to pick one. There's nothing in this segment that you should need help with. :)

So instead, a bit about this walkthrough, and the steps to get platinum.

* ''Walkthrough''
** I played on hardcore mode, and I will be giving advice specific to it.
** The game is, in truth, very straightforward. You don't need me to beat the game, and you don't need me to get platinum.
:
* ''For Platinum''
** Grind both levels to 99
** Get a lot of character events (...you don't need them all, I think, but a lot of them lead to trophies eventually)
** Make the Flying Board (Lotte).
** Stera's ending is nebulous, but it seems tied to doing life tasks. You'll get a special event with Solle about this. I did 103 non-main tasks on my NG+ run and got it. You will also need to see the "Stera" events, particularly those involving Miruca. And you'll possibly need both basket upgrades, but that should be easy.
** The NG+ requirements are speculative. (It's too easy to do, so nobody ever tested it.)
*** Fulfill the hidden end requirement.
*** 100 friendship between Shallies (is it possible to even have less?!)
*** Motivation should be 70+% filled (no super excessive grinding and you're okay)
*** View all the Escha events about the seeds
:
* ''PS3 Version Players''
** I created a playlist containing all the Plus additions so you don't have to feel like you're missing anything.
** Starts at Chapter 6, when the changes begin.

=--Note--=

I don't necessarily list all of the events ASAP. If you're confused because you're either
earlier or later than I am, click on the links to see the full event lists.

If you see events not listed, they're associated with life tasks.

=-=

For those of you on hardcore, this is the "terrifying" part of the game. You need not fight every enemy as you see them, and some may be outright too hard for
you. Or maybe you can fight one or two, but then you have to go back to town. Battles become much easier after you activate Burst, so... you'll definitely
want to learn to abuse that feature. For Lotte in particular, wait for Wilbell in the second chapter to do any real fighting.

* ''Lotte''
** Just keep fumbling through her events till you are allowed to go to a field for Raoul.
** Once you gather at this area, you'll get Miruca.
** Why are the cleaning requests so addicting?
** Exclusive trophy, of course, when you meet Wilbell.
** As soon as you put 500 items in the container, you'll get a scene and life task for 999 items. Don't go out of your way to get these; they'll both happen naturally. The scene can trigger at any point after this chapter too.
:
* ''Stera''
** You start with Jurie and Kortes, so you don't face the difficulties Lotte does.
** Once you hit level 10, you'll get a scene with Kortes and a life task to get to level 50. This can trigger whenever, so no rush to get it.

Once you go through an area, I suggest creating the basic alchemic items you have available. They make a huge difference.

The game requires you to do Life Tasks. Depending on the rate at which you fulfill them, your motivation will go up or down. If your motivation is low, you
get a reduced walking speed, and the game will otherwise try to annoy you. The game is telling you that you need to stop screwing around, basically. Worry not;
in the final chapter, your motivation will be permanently maxed, so just try and avoid grindy behaviors until then. When you do tasks, you may see that you received
an exp bonus. This will take effect the next time you battle or synth.

The plot required life task(s) should be fairly obvious, because you really aren't allowed to even THINK about anything else until you've satisfied the plot. After that,
you get free time to do other main life tasks. You don't have to do all the main tasks, and frankly, you can't. Once you do enough, the game will sweep the rest of them away.
Certain life tasks are triggered by others. For instance, an equipment task will lead to another task telling you to make accessories. If you are the OCD sort, I have /most/ of
these tasks listed.

In order to trigger any free time life task, you do these basic things first: turn in a request, go to the world map, make an item.

As for all the other kinds of life tasks, however, you should be able to do all of those, if you are so inclined.

Soon, you'll meet Katla on Hilt Street; she runs a shop and you should definitely buy her recipe books when you can afford it.

So here's a tip. Talk to everyone once each chapter till you get the life task for talking to 50 people. (I dunno if repetition works, honestly.)
It'll upgrade your bell/broom swing so you can annihilate enemies without battling.

** WILBELL AT THE HARBOR GET GET GET. She's the powerhouse you NEED.
** You'll get ambushed when you try to approach the automaton.
*** Bring some crafts, activate Burst ASAP, use any attacks that hit multiple enemies, and you'll be fine. Hopefully.
*** Basically, take them out as fast as possible. I was about level 10 for this fight (hardcore).
** Once you clear the plot, Nady will give you a life task. Get [[Leather]] x50. THANKS MOM.
*** You can buy [[Wild Pelt|Wild Pelts]] from Linca and Rosemia (she's coming soon).
*** You make 4 leathers at a time, and using a wind skill on [[Sand Runner Tailfeather]] you can make a fifth.
*** That's a minimum of 10 synths, 30 pelts, and a maximum of 13 synths, 39 pelts. Try to get this done by about Chapter 4.
** Purchase all the recipes you can; you should spend over 1000 Cole. That'll unlock a life task.

* ''Stera''
** Really? Stera has an easier time.

Linca will be available as a shopkeep. You do not need to buy Supplement Revolution for now. Black and White are well out of your league, and you'll get the rest in other books.

You may have noticed by now, but Raoul will periodically give you better jobs for doing requests. Eventually, you get more equipment slots out of him as well (I got my first
expansion in the next chapter), so just keep doing jobs and good things will happen. And it's really your only way to get money for a long, long time.

As for the Stera events... yeah, each Shallie gets her own icon on the menu, so they have personal events. They are exclusive to their own routes.

Want to level up super fast? Get 50 [[(Liquid)]], [[(Fuel)]], and [[(Plant)]] to unlock three life tasks, make the required [[(Medicine)]] to finish all three tasks, fight one battle, and HOLY CRAP.
I accidentally shot to level 21 this way. Along with some other body life tasks. On top of that, you should gather 600 items per region to get the full gathering benefits.
Well, you can start with the 100/200 item bonuses; don't do it all now! Just take a glance at [[Body|this section]] to see some of the stuff to do. Some of it really is good to know,
and at this point can get you a mass exp boost if you want it.

Protip: Visit [[Land of the Dead]] and [[Facility Ruins]] every now and then. Get the Slag Coins from their chests. You need 6 for a task later on, and they're kind of a pain in the butt. By the way,
most chests will get their items back after bopping five enemies and returning to Stellard. At least, I think that's the trigger. That also resets the strong glowy monsters that appear in the fields.

** If you spend all your money (like I did, on books) after you earn it, you'll get scolded by Miruca. I had less than 300 cole.
:
* ''Stera''
** Homura will introduce you to Rose at Solice Trade Camp. She's more conveniently at the Harbor, once you meet her.
** Raoul will have a request with (!) on it. That's a special one for Jurie, and it won't be the first of its kind. Do them as you see 'em.

You'll finally be allowed to make equipment with Miruca, as well as disassemble items. Homura will also join your party once you visit the Union, and you'll be introduced
to assists. And you'll meet a new shopkeep, Rose.

Eventually, Solle will introduce you to environmental changes. These will change shop items, monsters in areas, etc. Not really a big deal, unless you're after a specific item and suddenly less items appear in an area.
You should also be able to get your search equipment limit expanded with Raoul.

Such an empty section. How's your life goin'?

; TODO: Add Lotte Weapon Batch 2

Shallie finally meets Shallie.

* ''Lotte''
** If you need Gravistones, go to [[Filled Cave]]. Stera is awful impressed with my crap synthesis techniques.
** A scene with Miruca will unlock a life task about not eating. Just don't feed Lotte any [[(Food)]] for a while. (Make sure you've used food items a few times to trip this.)
:
* ''Stera''
** A scene between Stera and Kortes about exercise will unlock a life task. You can finish this immediately; just keep jumping.

At the Hunter's Hangout, you'll be introduced to mining. Both Shallies can do this, though it's not particularly rewarding.

You'll get a special request from Raoul with a (!) next to it. Talking about it reveals that it's a [[Stellapearl]] for Solle.
This is the first of its kind for Lotte; not so much for Stera.

...Unfortunately, there's really nothing to do in this chapter. No new areas, but you may choose to fight some bosses (I'll have
more on that next section). Just follow the life tasks and all is well. I'd suggest making sure you're around ADV level 25, and
Alch Level 35. You have the beginning of the next chapter to do this stuff too, so no rush.

To start off the chapter, however, you must be above alchemy level 20. You'll FINALLY unlock the ability to transfer ingredient properties
to the resulting item. I'd suggest just playing around with it for now, if you're new to the series. In particular, be aware that PP, which
is what you consume to put properties on items, can be boosted via other properties.

Of course, you get a trophy for kicking sand dragon ass.

If you have the relevant DLC, Escha and/or Solle will join during free time. Solle joined before even that, in the Plus version.

During your free time, you should get more search equipment slots. This will be your final upgrade. Depending on how many life tasks you did, you'll also unlock up to two
basket upgrades with Solle. Don't rush if you haven't unlocked both. Both Lotte and Stera will also unlock their exclusive abilities this chapter -- fishing and dowsing, respectively.

Escha will also open her shop after a couple events.
The Wilbell Life Task looks a little scary, but the sheep will never hit you back. Turn it to easy, beat the crap out of it. Then, don't be like me. Remember to
turn the difficulty back! Jurie's events will unlock the [[Drifting Ghost Ship]]. Explore it till you get stuck -- an event next chapter will open the way. I suppose
it's possible to view it in this chapter too, but I never have.

After all the plot plot plot, the two parties join together to defeat the Sand Dragon. WELL. Finally, I get to tell you how to do stuff.
The game was simply too easy and straightforward before. So here's a lengthy tutorial series. Do note, I'm not going out of the way to break the game.

=--Synthesis--=

If you're at (or are willing to grind to) level 35 and you're feeling experimental, I'll have some further stuff you can do. If you want.

Linca has some good stuff you should buy. Stuff like Ancient Map. (I know Diamond Ore looks OOOH SHINY, but you have nothing that takes
a Jewel item.) By the time you're done, you're going to see how ridiculously useful Plant Oil is. Attribute Absorb when appropriate, but
not on any equipment or usable items. Use decent items. You want a high effect.

This stuff takes a while, and I made a ton of mistakes in the process myself. Save often, and if you want to cheap out... well, go for it.
This set is somewhat overkill, but it'll (sort of) get you through one of the hardest areas that you can access at this point.


''PP Boosting Item''

: Create a [[Honey]] using an Ancient Map. Keep [[PP Frame Expansion]].
: Now make Supplement - Green using a Cactus Palm and Honey. Use the Property Lv+ skill (this will fuse with Destructive Power+ on the Cactus Palm), and you might as well Attribute Absorb too. Keep both PP expansions and [[Big Destructive Power]].
: Create a Plant Oil with PP Frame Expansion & PP +7.

[[Silkis Feather]]

: Make a [[Armored Bunker]]. You will need to either toss in a Holinica Ore or get the property through [[Holinicait]]. Keep [[Attack & Defense Enhance]].
: Toss directly into [[Supplement - Red]]. Use the PP Boosting Plant Oil from earlier. Keep Attack & Defense Enhance, Transfer PP +7, PP Frame Expansion.
: Transfer to [[Zettel]], then [[Honey]], then [[Handspun Rabbit Yarn]].
: Create a [[Supplement - Yellow]] using Red Clay. Keep Speed +5.
: Transfer property directly to [[Plant Oil]].
: Make a Silkis Feather using that Plant Oil and [[Sand Runner Tailfeather]]. Use Property Lv+. Keep [[Speed Enhance]] and [[Defense +5]].
: Imbue a [[Gold Embroidered Coat]] using that Silkis Feather and your Handspun Rabbit Yarn. Use Property Lv+. Keep [[Stat Enhance]]. See why you need PP boosting?
: Make a Silkis Feather using that Gold Embroidered Coat, Slag Cable (so you can use Cost Down), and Honey. Keep [[Stat Enhance]] and [[Attack & Defense Enhance]].
: Note the PP costs (18). You'll absolutely need both PP Frame Expansion and Transfer PP +7 in the future, which gives you 25 PP.

[[Holinicait]] / [[Ingot]]

: Take that Silkis Feather and toss everything on it into a [[Stylish Broom]]. Be sure to include PP Boosting stuff on your Palma Wood.
: Toss that Stylish Broom into a [[Fire Lord's Charcoal]]. Use a PP Boosting Plant Oil, and be sure to Number/Count+.
: Transfer to all the Ingots you like. Ingots are only necessary for Miruca + Holinic Full Metal, so just one Holinica synth will get you what you need. For everything else, there are supplements.
: For PP, put the relevant properties onto a Lightning Bomb, disassemble with Miruca. Old Stones are fantastic. Remember to Cost Down on it.

''Further Notes''

: If you have [[Supplement - Black]], you can directly toss in a [[Mantis Blade]] for [[Barrage Attack]]. Not a big deal if you don't have it.
: This only applies to weapons. Go for it if you want.
: I leave third properties free for you to decide. I already got you two badass ones.
: You can try to fuse your own Defense Enhances/Speed Enhances, whatever you like, or you can just go with whatever is native to the equipment via Property Lv+.
: Just don't be cute and try to get the All Stats series on our weapons/armor. That's accessory exclusive.
: For accessories, try Fire Lord's Charcoal -> Supplement - Red -> Plant Oil -> Handspun Rabbit Yarn -> Stellard Fabric. Bear in mind that you must be careful about transferring properties to the Yarn (and also the Oil/Supplement before it). I had two separate Yarns.
: It's worth noting that Stellard Fabric disassembles to Handspun Rabbit Yarn.
: I like to transfer all my equip properties to accessories. The lazy life is the only life.

''Weapons''

Follow this stuff for "better" items. You don't strictly need to do it if you're sick of this tutorial. Just try to actually get effects on your weapons.
Always include a PP Boosting Item. Always. From Plant Oil, this should be a trivial process to get onto anything you need.

You should aim to get effects of all elements. Higher effects are not necessarily better, and if you don't have Supplement - Black, water attributes are tough. Here are my notes:

: [[Resonance Chime]] / [[Sword Manipulation Ring]] / [[Silver Twin Swords]] (if no Supplement - Black, otherwise just use that and ignore me!)
:: LV 35+
:: Make [[Water Crystal]], get the LV3 Property on it. Transfer [[Elemental Attribute - Water]] to [[Media Book]], then disassemble with Miruca for a [[Zettel]].
:: Zettel -> Honey -> Supplement -> Plant Oil -> Palma Board (Stera)
:: From the Supplement, transfer to a Lightning Bomb, then disassemble to Old Stone (Wilbell).
:: From the Plant Oil, make an Abrasive (Jurie)
+
: [[Stylish Broom]]
:: [[Verdant Taun]] is useful. Or Umbrella Tree Strawberry.
:: Press square. Move Verdant Taun to the third slot. Give it Order+ 3. You win.
+
: [[Elemental Charm]]
:: The Giant Fossil at Rose's Shop should prove helpful.
:: Use that Fire Lord's Charcoal from earlier, toss into Supplement - Red. If you don't want to use that directly, toss it into a Sea Clan's Charm.
+
: [[Flame Bunker]] / [[Demon Ore Sword]]
:: You can use the Old Stone (for Wilbell) trick above.
:: Or you can buy Giant Triangular Fangs from Rose.


''Armor''

: [[Fur Shirt]] (Stera/Lotte... and everyone else, if you want)
:: [[Giant Scale]] and [[Slag Cable]] should be handy. Something with earth would be good as a final ingredient.
+
: [[Leather Shirt]] (Stera/Lotte... and everyone else, if you want)
:: High wind effects recommended. Herbal Shirt is more convenient. High Collar Shirt will net you the higher (better) wind effects.
:: For water effect, you'll need the LV 35+ trick above, and you'll want Elemental Attribute - Water on probably Leather and/or Plant Oil.
+
: [[Holinic Full Metal]] (Kortes/Homura/Miruca)
:: This is extra costly. To soften the blow, let's use Old Stone so you can use Number+.
:: (LV 35+) If you have Supplement - Black, then... Burning Gas (get LV3 property, Elemental Attribute - Wind) -> Supplement Red -> Lightning Bomb, disassemble to Old Stone.
+
: [[Gold Embroidered Coat]] (Jurie/Wilbell)
:: (LV 35+) From the Honey listed with Elemental Attribute - Water, make a Handspun Rabbit Yarn. Imbue an Agile Coat.
:: What about Fire, you ask? It's impossible.

''Attack Items''
: Using the Plant Oil trick, get [[Big Destructive Power]] and [[Critical]] on whatever Supplements you like. If you want a third property, pick one now.
: If you super care (you really shouldn't), you can get [[Ultimate Destructive Power]] at level 35+... if you can make [[Burning Gas]], anyway.
: Make a [[Lava Cube]] using Phlogiston, Bomb, PP Boosting Plant Oil, and Supplement - White/Red. Be sure to get all three Properties and reduce the size of the item. You'll get [[Scorching Earth]] as a property. You can also try carrying [[Carries Heat]] from a [[Bomb]]. It's actually one of the best debuffing properties in the game.
: Put some effort into an [[Ice Bomb]]. It'll help you for the boss.
: Unlike Escha & Logy, this game doesn't really give you a ton of awesome usable item options. It actually nerfed a lot of stuff to the point that items are mostly best as debuffs/buffs/healing. Equipment is where you'll want to spend most of your time.

* ''Areas Unlocked:'' [[Nomad Camp]], [[Hidden Forest]], [[Crystal Valley]], [[Hole of the Dead]]

* ''Lotte''
** At the Nomad Camp (I think you need to have Bait?), you'll be informed about the existence of the [[Fish Lord]] at [[Green Desert]]. You'll need 100+ effect bait to get it.
** You get an exclusive trophy on Lotte's side after finding Faav Village.
:
* ''Stera''
** At Solice Trade Camp, you unlock a life task... to KILL the Food Rabbits Stera wants to pet so badly.
** After a couple scenes with Teo, you'll get a recipe for the Dowsing Rod.

For those of you on the Plus version, this is where things begin to diverge.
Enjoy all your Logy cutscenes, especially when he joins the party.

Katla will offer you an automata for an absurdly low price. Just kidding, of course. You don't need to buy it - the plot will just give it to you.
She'll throw in a Gold Coin of Fortune that has decent properties on it (if you buy for full price), but nothing mindblowing. Then you hand it off to Albert.
If you must buy it on your first run, note that she'll later sell it for 20,000 Cole. Avoid her till you've acquired enough money.

In any case, you'll meet Harry at Faav Village. He runs the last shop of the game, though you won't get anything good from him just yet.

* ''PS3 Version Players''
** As I said much earlier, I made a youtube playlist containing the Plus additions. They start at this chapter.
** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQktyFBCcQggmp87_SyHJ-et1SsOv3bzy

=--Money!--=

Start by making a Plant Fertilizer with High Price + (the LV2 property). Then make a second
one with High Price +, and use the Get Rich skill to make [[High Class Item]]. Make a
Supplement - Blue using both fertilizers (you may need Ingredient Zero).

Transfer all to a Plant Oil, then make a [[Holinic Steel Plate]]. Get the LV3 property. Keep Premium Price.
Do not keep High Price if you see it. Holinics are kind of a pain, though, so let's find something else.

As it turns out, you can make an [[Uni]] using a steel plate and supplement. You know what to do.
Disassemble with Miruca, then toss that Broken Item into a Supplement - White.

You are free to optimize this if you wish, but this version is good enough and easy to reproduce via Plant Oil.
Supplement - White is notably better for selling than other kinds of Supplements.

=-=


=--LV 40 Warning (PS3 only)--=

Once you hit level 40, you unlock the growth system. This requires the 1.01 update to work. If you don't have it (though I imagine most of you do), don't touch the growth system.

Do NOT, under any circumstances, upgrade Lotte's Defense Assist. It will prevent you from using auto-use items. (Yes, that is a huge deal, even if it doesn't seem like one now.)

Secondly, my recommendations for upgrades consider the end-game, high end synths. The optimal stuff. Focus on crit rate and crit bonuses first,
then item bonuses for alchemists, then skill power upgrades. I always do stats last.

If you have Escha, all her stuff is just flat out wrong (not at all unusual for DLC, unfortunately). The correct list is [[Battle|in this section]]. Solle has similar issues,
but his descriptions are correct.

Don't use a Travel Gate until you've gotten all events. It can interfere with resetting shops too.
And you may want to wait until the next chapter asks you to make one anyway.

Your motivation will be zero while the Shallies are separated. Hurry the plot along and it'll bounce back to full, and your walking speed will be nice and zippy again.
Aaaand you'll get your chosen alchemist's ability, which unlocks in burst. With Stera, it's frankly lame. It duplicates items at 60% power. Lotte's is
the significantly better Mix, where you choose two items and combine them. Though if you don't know the mechanics behind it, you won't get far at all.
(It's much weirder than you think. The items you use matter, and you are free to use two of the same item. The properties you use matter, but not in a common sense manner. The effect does not matter.)

Raoul's events will grant you an awesome Gunade Ring. Hang onto it for now; the next section has a tutorial that uses it.

After getting Rose's event, you'll need to head into the Drifting Ghost Ship to see the rest of her story. You'll get the one and only key item in the game there. This is also
a decent place to actually finish off the ghost ship, if you haven't already. This is worth a bunch of events for Jurie and a trophy for beating the boss at the end.
(If you already did all that, you still need to go back for Rose.)

* ''Areas Unlocked:'' [[Sea of Eternity]], [[Tunnel of Plants]], [[Water Garden of Origins]], [[Forest of Miracles]], [[Path to the Altar]], [[Altar of Spirits]], [[Drifting Cemetery]], [[Heaven's Vine]], [[Heaven's Vine - Root Division]], [[Heaven's Vine - Sapling]], [[The Furthest Village]], [[Castle of Mirages]]

Go to five water sources for the task. Ten for the ability to get more water at the City Water Source. Thanks to Aster Selene for this info. The water sources are at the following locations:
* [[Fertile Sea - Northern Area]]
* [[Facility Ruins]]
* [[Abandoned Factory]]
* [[Sea of Eternity]]
* [[Filled Cave]]
* [[Solice Trade Camp]]
* [[Land of Fallen Stars]]
* [[Green Desert]]
* [[Tunnel of Plants]]
* [[Water Garden of Origins]]

After finishing that task, you'll have two more things to do in this chapter; find Keith, and fight the Water Lord. You can go straight to the Water Lord, but you have to stop at Faav Village
to unlock the area Keith's at. You'll be doing a lot of exploring this chapter. Either way you go, you'll want to be prepared for a fight.

At the Castle of Mirages, you'll eventually hit a dead end. You need to fight all the enemies in the area to unlock the way. They're tough. After doing both tasks, you will get Keith in your party.

Right at the end of the chapter, you'll get a trophy. Shame there's no Raoul or Kortes swimsuit action. But especially Raoul.

Let's see, you get a trophy for...

* The event right before fighting the Water Lord
* Beating the Water Lord
* For finding Keith
* Escha's Sweets Fair
* For the Water Festival event after you "complete the check"
* And you can't forget the one for clearing the chapter.

=--Equips!--=

Disassemble a Ziegel Nugget to get Silver Groundwater.

You can call this the "easy platinum" set. And I mean I created a set, right here, that carried
me through the hardest fight in the game... on Story Watcher difficulty. This is a very viable set
for those of you who just want the platinum.

This is also good for property grinding for ultimate equips. You'll want a pretty decent set like this
to take care of the bosses easily.

You have that Gunade Ring that Raoul gave you, right? Because you need it. It has [[Attack Huge Enhance]],
[[Defense Huge Enhance]], and [[Speed Huge Enhance]]. You can create these yourself, but it's luck based, as
you need to rare material farm (via bosses, perhaps) to get the properties you need.

First, toss your Gunade Ring's properties into a Blue Crystal Ring (use Ingredient Zero and Cost Down).
Then transfer to Supplement - Rainbow. These properties total 24 PP, so make sure you can afford that.

Yep, it was that easy. Getting stuff from any supplement to about any other item is trivial and
I'll leave it to you. Among the items you can create, five will directly take that supplement.

In the event that you're feeling more experimental (you may have some decent properties from bosses, but only a few),
you can get PP Frame Maximization by using a Plant Oil (from Chapter 5) with Transfer PP +7 / PP Frame Expansion
in a Supplement - Red, then getting the LV3 Property.

Escha's weapon... just wait till free time.

Personally, my accessories were Gunade Ring (minus the better speed effect) and Dragon Shield (with
More Explosive Power). These served me well, so actually bother getting good effects on your equipment.
Trust me.

Also, [[Synthesis Skill Frame Increase]] (Medical Solution) is very, very helpful (though 15 PP).
It gives items an additional skill slot. But only experiment with this if you really want to.
You'll have to use it for high end synths, but for now it's for fun.

By the way, with this setup, I beat the Lord of Water on Despair difficulty. Which is NG+ exclusive,
but I was playing on a fresh file. It was a close battle because she took out both my alchemists in
one swoop, but I DID IT. I was about level 49 for the fight, which was primarily because of all
the life task exp bonuses I got.

Oh, right, and here's a mini-tutorial on what the crap the chain stuff is about. It can help.

By now, you've surely noted that items all have elemental attributes, and if you followed my earlier
tutorial, you'd know that the Elemental Attribute properties can grant new ones to items. Well,
to chain, you spam skills of the same element consecutively. No gaps between earth skills, for
instance. The catch is that the item MUST be of the same element as the skill element you're spamming.
Something like a Supplement - Red can only have fire skills, but a Rainbow one can have any
element applied. There is an exception. Maybe a glitch? But if you have, say, an earth skill
on a Burning Gas (Fire/Wind exclusively), you can put it in the last slot to start the earth
chain. This works with single slot items too, but either way it MUST start the chain.

And this is relevant because you should be able to use Chain [Element] skills as well as Chain
Effect to help you out.

But here's an example for you to try out, if you wish:

* Demonkin Ring

** Supplement - Rainbow - Chain Water, Chain Effect, whatever earth
** Sword Manipulation Ring - Add Earth
** Alto Metal - Attribute Absorb, Ingot+
** Sand Dragon Scale - Whatever earth x2

Note that the order DOES matter. Press square to move items around. A chain of 1024 results
in +30 Effect thanks to Chain Effect. Synthesis Skill Frame Increase can give you up to 3 further
slots, using that setup. At level 99, you'll use this technique to get 999 Effect items.

And do note how much the chain drops if you put, say, a fire skill on the Alto Metal.

* ''Areas Unlocked:'' [[Geofront]], [[Herb Garden]], [[Herb Garden - Depths]], [[Hidden Cave]]

* The automaton are at the following locations: (After you find three 'in the wild', nothing will appear at the remaining field. Al has two as part of the story, you fetch two more, and Faav is the last you get)
** Heaven's Vine
** Castle of Mirages
** Crystal Valley
** Faav Village (you can just take the goddess, lol)

After the scene at Ruins of Frozen Time, you'll unlock Geofront. If you head straight down the path you'll hit a roadblock; you'll return to this place in Chapter 10.
So worry about the Indirect Bypass area instead. Continue exploring for a big plot dump, and eventually the truth
about Linca as well. As for the event that happens at Hidden Cave -- pick whoever you want. Miruca gives you a Double Foot Component, if you super care.

''Optional Bosses'':
* [[Silver Dragon]] at Geofront (warning: transforms into one of two forms on turn four, will kick your ass if unprepared)
* [[Fran Pfeil]] when you cross the Dusk Sea via the northern route (be careful).
** Plus version players: Beating this leads to the much stronger [[Coral Dragon]] the next time you take that route.
* [[Prototype 0|Prototype trio]] at Ruins of Frozen Time
* [[Servant of the Beast King]] at Herb Garden - Depths
* [[Phoenix of the Sea]] at Altar of Spirits
* [[Rage Guardian]] at Crystal Valley

Since you've made it this far, I'd seriously appreciate it if you hit that green yes button that's been following you around,
if you haven't already.

* ''Plus Note''
** Be extra sure to have seen all the Seed-related events.

Before I go on, if you're on Stera's side be sure to have a Talisman of Ancient Beasts with you. You'll get extra dialogue
with this boss.

Go to Geofront. Instead of going toward the warp, go straight to the area that used to be a dead end. You'll run into a boss fight worth a trophy.
If you lose, he's gone forever, so beware. He's best beaten on a second run, but you can do it on the easiest difficulty, at
a decent level, with pretty mediocre (stat boosting) equipment. I know because I did it.

Here's my super duper cheap way of beating the King of Ancient Beasts. Level 55. Story Watcher difficulty.
This is for those of you who want the game to end ASAP.

Lead off with Kortes in the back, possibly Jurie as well. Do not use Wilbell's Volcano skill.
Make sure you get 110% when you activate burst, and pick Kortes and/or Jurie. Preferably, you can
swap someone out to get 120+ for both. On top of that, I had a Lava Cube with [[Carries Heat]]
going. But that's about it. He went down.

My equipment? The stuff I made in the chapter 8. Zero changes. But to give a full rundown... (it isn't that special):

* Gunade Ring with Herculean Strength/Divine Protection, but just Speed
* Dragon Shield with More Explosive Power / Fighting Spirit S / Tranquil Spirit
* Weapons with Enhance Burst, Enhance Item (when applicable), Enhance Skill. Enhance Crit was emphasized, but not everywhere.
* Armor had DMG Cut, kind of a crapshoot after that. Wilbell/Jurie had Critical.
* Everything had Attack/Speed/Defense Huge Enhance.
* Basically, put a lot into burst damage bonuses and kill him within a single burst.
* If you don't manage to kill him in burst, he wins. Seriously. I don't care if he has 1000 health left (I've been there).
* Oooor you can make "real" equipment and beat him the hard way. (Or just grind to level 99 and beat him anyway on Hardcore.)

''Beyond the Beast King is the path to the final dungeon'', as well as the DLC part of Geofront. There's nothing special to add, honestly.
Go forth and beat the tar out of the final boss.

So go ahead and read up on [[Ultimate Synths]] if you want to beat bosses the hard way. There is a tooooon of good stuff in there.

* Plus Version Bosses (NO HOPE HP values listed)
** Cobalt Dragon (600,000 HP) will appear after beating Fran Pfeil, along the same route.
** Ruler of Beast Kings (500,000 HP) is in the "DLC Area", The Abyss. You should be able to sneak around him for the recipe book beyond him.
** As with the PS3 version, the Controller (500,000 HP) is at the end of that area
** After beating the Controller, Omnipotent (750,000 HP) appears in the same spot when you return.

You'll get to choose which end you take, so make a save after beating the final boss to avoid some of the blah blah blah.

* End requirements
** Lotte/Stera generics, automatically given
** Make the Flying Board (Lotte).
** Stera's ending seems tied to doing life tasks (and a Solle event telling you how great you are). You'll get a special event with Solle about this. I did 103 non-main tasks on my NG+ run and got it.
** For the NG+ end, just fulfill the non-generic requirements.
** In Plus, if you did all the Seed-related events, you get an extension apparently. (I haven't seen the non-extended version.)

If there's a terrible translation in there (there are a number of them that I already tried to fix), you can email/PM me about it
and I'll see if I can figure it out for you.

Divine Power is a bad, bad translation. It's Mystery. Hides are, more obviously, pelts.

For some builds, you may require some other stuff. See the next section if that kind of thing appeals to you.

To farm for properties, well, bleh. This is stolen from afreaknamedpete. The DLC dungeon may be somewhat helpful (with Plant Fertilizer, I'd imagine), but I haven't tried it out myself yet.

* You'll want to aim for hardcore (as a minimum), since you get better drops. Though you can start out on certain enemies on Story Watcher if you need to.
** Plus: Only do that if you're having extreme difficulty beating enemies.
* Fight the [[Silver Dragon]] at Geofront's Indirect Bypass. You can fight this on story watcher, but upgrade to hardcore or higher ASAP.
** Plus: Don't do that. They nerfed it. However, several turns in, it will transform into one of two (difficult) dragons which WILL drop good properties. This works on story watcher, but it's better on hardcore and above. (Actually, once you hit Despair this becomes more trouble than it's worth.)
* Fight the [[Phoenix of the Sea]] at the Altar of Spirits.
** Plus: This is the best enemy to kill, but do it on Despair or higher once you can. It'll spend its first turn just staring at you.
** Don't fight this enemy on a difficulty below hardcore, period. You need the two best drops, and you don't have good odds of getting them at the lower two difficulties.
* Fight [[Rage Guardian]] at Crystal Valley. You need luck but occasionally it drops good stuff. Don't do this below hardcore.
* Finally, there's [[Servant of the Beast King]], which should probably be fought on Despair or higher. Very occasional good stuff.
* Bop five enemies of your choosing to annihilate them, and return to Stellard. This resets the bosses.
* Preferably, you'll gather Dunkelheits at Herb Garden on each iteration. It's possible to farm these in the DLC dungeon as well, I hear.

This is, for better or for worse, a great way to level grind. I'd suggest equipping a couple [[Treasure Grimoire|Treasure Grimoires]] -- one for
EXP, the other for item drops. The closer to 999, the better. If you happen to be on
NO HOPE, the item drops are guaranteed so you don't need to bother with the drop
increasing nonsense.

For Plus, bring ''Ayesha''. She has a passive that increases item drops. Since they nerfed
the Silver Dragon, you should unlock Despair and NO HOPE by beating the game, if you
haven't already. Also, there's this nasty thing called the Coral Dragon that pops up after beating
Fran Pfeil (which, incidentally, drops nice stuff but only once). Yeah. If you don't
beat it on a lower difficulty or something, you'll have to take a longer route.

===Build Discussion===

Here's a full rundown of the characters. This includes all passives and the base crit rate (estimated to be 25%), including those you buy through the growth system (but not the stat upgrades that you can buy).
The number in parenthesis next to crit power includes the bonus associated with that character's best weapon. Crit power has a base of 25%, which is also added in.

Basically, this table is the justification for all the crazy stuff I'll have you do later. But you do have freedom. Keep in mind that crit power has a 100% cap,
but skill power does not have a cap. See [[Equipment Effects]] for more. The advanced mechanics section in general is a good read if you're interested in custom builds.
Or you can just let me tell you what to do. You'll curbstomp everything.

There's only one property that increases item damage -- [[Valorous Soul]]. Yep, that's really it.

There are several builds you can do. My tutorial will gear you toward a generic set. If you want to do one of these specialized sets, I'll help you to an extent,
but not every special set is accounted for. A lot of the special sets use minor variations on the vanilla set. I'll tell you when you can follow the tutorial
(you may have to customize properties) for them.

=--Vanilla Overview--=

Weapons will generally emphasize the following:

* Enhance Burst
* Skill / Item Power
* Accuracy (when opposed to Break -- BUT Break does increase damage for enemies that can actually be broken... if you care.)
* Enhance Crit
* Attack Power (lowest priority of all these)
* Valorous Soul, Force Soul, Persisting Attack

And armor will emphasize these:

* HP/MP... customize this to your build if you super care ([[Star Soul]] reverses them). Generally HP.
* Enhance Crit
* Defense
* DMG Cut
* Assist Recovery
* Alchemists: Awakened Soul, Benevolent Soul, Heroic Soul
* Everyone else: Awakened Soul, Evolving Body, Evolves the Body

The "vanilla" accessories are like this:

* Mirage Talisman @ Soul Evolution, Enhance Crit-XL
* (DLC) Thunder Outfit @ Shows Illusions, Consumes Stamina or Anger of Spirits
* Spirit Belt @ Power of Blessings
* 2x Earth Spirit Soul
* 2x Lord of Night Soul
* And the rest depends on the character

The idea is to max out the crit rate and crit damage bonus, max assist recovery, increase level, skill, and burst damage. Cutting damage is a bonus.
Alchemists are supporting roles only, and most of your damage will probably come from Wilbell.

=-=

=--Attack Alchemist Stera--=

* [[Sea Alchemist's Bell]] @ Enhance Burst, Accuracy, Enhance Item, Enhance Skill; w/ Valorous Soul, Champion Soul (or an all stats variant), Speed Huge Enhance
* [[Divine Shirt]] @ Max MP, Enhance Crit, Defense, DMG Cut; w/ Awakened Soul, Benevolent Soul, Heroic Soul
* [[Heart of Fire]] @ Hide Figure, Power of Light; w/ Lord of Night Soul, Wind Spirit Soul, All Stats Power Up
* [[Thunder Outfit]] @ Blessing of Spirits, Show Illusions; w/ Lord of Night Soul, Wind Spirit Soul, All Stats Power Up

I have tutorials for all of these.

Heart of Fire is used over Mirage Talisman due to item power contributing more damage than Level and Burst Power.

I'd suggest using this if Stera is your main; otherwise, give her a different build.

=-=

=--Mix Lotte--=

* [[Magia Sumonitora]] @ Enhance Burst, Shorten Item, Enhance Crit, Enhance Skill; w/ Valorous Soul, Super Skills, Skill Huge Enhance
* [[Divine Shirt]] @ Max MP, Enhance Crit, Speed, Evade Attack; w/ Awakened Soul, Evolving Body, Evolves the Body
* [[Mirage Talisman]] @ Soul Evolution, Awakening of Souls, Enhance Crit-XL, Awakened Soul; w/ Skill Huge Enhance, Skill Savings, Skill Boost
* [[Thunder Outfit]] @ Consumes Stamina, Show Illusions; w/ Skill Huge Enhance, Skill Savings, Skill Boost

Tutorials for everything. You just need to change the properties to skill-related ones (which isn't recommended on alchemists except for this set).

You will need a couple special [[Living Trash Can|Living Trash Cans]]. They look like this:

* Trash @ Steals Speed, Absorbs All, MP Consume-L; w/ Deadly Strike or Consumes Soul, Curse of Powerlessness/Defenselessness/Slowness

I would recommend Deadly Strike for the auto-crit.

=-=


=--Support Speed/Quick Alchemist--=

Basically a setup alchemist. Make your non-main alchemist this.

* Weapon @ Burst Bonus, Shorten Item, Enhance Skill, Accuracy or Enhance Crit; w/ Champion Soul, All Stat Boost, Speed Huge Enhance
* [[Divine Shirt]] @ Max MP, Enhance Crit, Speed, Evade Attack; w/ Awakened Soul, Evolving Body, Evolves the Body
* [[Divine Soul]] @ Images of Light, DMG Absorb; w/ Lord of Night Soul, All Stats Power Up, Lord of Day Soul
* [[Meteor Boots]] @ Tireless Legs, Quick Action, Resists Impacts, Speed +25; w/ Lord of Night Soul, All Stats Power Up, Lord of Day Soul

Tutorials for all. This set emphasizes speed and Quick turns. It's designed to buff, debuff, then Time Watch.

Lord of Day Soul can be replaced with anything you like.

=-=

=--Max Damage Jurie--=

I mean it literally; Jurie is capable of max damage. Note that her weapon is downgraded to eliminate the need for Wind Spirit Soul.

* [[Bloody Claws]] @ Enhance Skill, Enhance Burst, Enhance Crit, Enhance Break; w/ Valorous Soul, Force Soul, Persisting Attack
* [[Divine Shirt]] @ Max MP, Enhance Crit, Speed, Evade Attack; w/ Awakened Soul, Evolving Body, Evolves the Body
* [[Mirage Talisman]] @ Soul Evolution, Awakenening of Souls, Enhance Crit-XL; w/ Lord of Night Soul, Sky Soul, Skill Huge Enhance
* [[Thunder Outfit]] @ Consumes Stamina, Shows Illusions; w/ Lord of Night Soul, Sky Soul, Skill Huge Enhance

You're on your own for the Bloody Claws. With good buff items, her attack should reach the cap. Evolving/Evolves may be unnecessary in that case, in which case
Benevolent and Heroic Soul would give a bit more damage. (Yeah, experiment with that if you want.)

=-=

=--Infinite Turn Keith--=

Note the downgraded weapon to eliminate the need for Wind Spirit Soul.

* [[Zodiac Gem]] @ Enhance Skill, Enhance Burst, Enhance Crit, Accuracy; w/ Valorous Soul, Force Soul, Persisting Attack
* [[Divine Coat]] @ Max HP, Assist Recovery, Defense, Less Action Chance; w/ Awakened Soul, Evolving Body, Evolves the Body
* [[Divine Soul]] @ Images of Light, DMG Absorb; w/ Lord of Night Soul, Halve MP Consumption, Earth Spirit Soul or Skill Savings
* [[Meteor Boots]] @ Tireless Legs, Quick Action, Resists Impacts; w/ Lord of Night Soul, Halve MP Consumption, Earth Spirit Soul or Skill Savings

You're on your own for the Zodiac Gem.

Homura, Wilbell, and Jurie can all use this set too, but they have other roles to fill.

Images of Light revives KOed characters, so if Keith is killed the game will revive and resume infinite turns. Keith has ridiculously low assist recovery, hence Earth Spirit Soul x2 AND Assist-L.
Not a requirement by any means.

=-=

=--Burst Building Homura--=

* [[Meteorite Sword]] @ Enhance Skill, Burst Bonus, Enhance Crit, Accuracy; w/ Burst Addition++, Burst Up, Twin Burst
* [[Divine Shirt]] @ Max MP, Enhance Crit, Speed, Evade Attack; w/ Awakened Soul, Evolving Body, Evolves the Body
* [[Thunder Outfit]] @ Blessing of Spirits, Show Illusions; w/ Lord of Night Soul, Sky Soul, Dark God Soul or All Stats Power Up
* [[Meteor Boots]] @ Tireless Legs, Quick Action, Resists Impacts, Speed +25; w/ Lord of Night Soul, Sky Soul, Dark God Soul or All Stats Power Up

You'll need to figure out the Metorite Sword on your own.

Dark God Soul should be used if you are also using a Time Watch.

For a small variant, use Valorous/Force/Persisting on the sword, and drop Sky Soul from accessories.
Homura will get the first few turns; use Chaos Blades to break the boss, burst, then nuke the boss with someone else.

=-=

=--Burst Building Escha--=

This is a MIN DAMAGE set. Basically pure setup for someone else. The weapon needs low effect.

* [[Sky Alchemy Staff]] @ Enhance Break; w/ Burst Addition ++, Burst Up, Twin Burst
* [[Riveted Shirt]] @ Max HP, Avoid KO, Speed, Evade Attack; w/ Speed Huge Enhance, Speed Boost, Defense & Speed Boost
* [[Divine Soul]] @ Images of Light, DMG Absorb; w/ Lord of Night Soul, Halve MP Consumption, Dark God Soul or All Stats Power Up
* [[Meteor Boots]] @ Tireless Legs, Quick Action, Resists Impacts, Speed +25; w/ Lord of Night Soul, Halve MP Consumption, Dark God Soul or All Stats Power Up

This doubles as a chain building set. As with Homura, Dark God Soul is for Time Watch usage.

You'll have to figure out the Sky Alchemy Staff and Rivited Shirt.

=-=

=--Assist Tank Solle--=

* Vanilla weapon/armor
* [[Planet Sphere]] @ Scent Monsters Like, Power of Time; w/ Light God Soul, Earth Spirit Soul, Lord of Day SOul
* [[Divine Soul]] @ Burns Brightly, Noble Power; w/ Light God Soul, Holy Soul, Star Soul

His skills are ridiculously slow, so Planet Sphere is used. But his assist guard allows him to tank any hit for 1 HP. This set makes that his only purpose.
His buffs aren't particularly good compared to items, so avoid them.

Keith can use this as well, but he may need an extra Earth Spirit Soul.

No tutorial for Planet Sphere.

=-=

=--Usage Notes--=

* Jurie is the best character to have, bar none. Her field burst is that good.
* If you have Solle, his Field Burst is also that good.
* Wilbell is generically your strongest unless you build Jurie or Lotte the correct way. Well, a proper Wilbell stomps Lotte. Keith is also pretty strong, and Jurie is always a good damage dealer regardless of whether she's the best.
* Escha is crazy broken for her ability to increase burst... DURING BURST. Her field burst increases item power, so that's useful too.
* Kortes has one (...and only one) rather useful feature: his field burst. I haven't tried infinite bursting with Escha + Kortes, but it may be possible.
* The setup alchemist can also be used to build chain via Lava Cube spamming. A fast Solle can work to the same effect.
* Attack items are honestly pretty garbage if used purely as attack items. Even Lotte's Mix set requires nonstandard items.
* Hence, items are best as chain builders, buff/debuff, and healing.
* Miruca is probably the most useless. One of her skills can be used to create a magic weakness on enemies; that's good with Wilbell. And that's her only use, poor girl.

=-=

===Prepwork===

Work your properties onto other items. Try to work all your items up to about 120 Effect. I like to stick with Supplements because they're easy to remember, easy to modify,
and easy to multiply. Here are some generic processes, depending on where your items are:

# [[(Mystery)]] items can go directly into Supplement Black or White. Black has the added bonus of accepting [[(Animal)]] items.
# There are a variety of [[(Medic. Ing.)]] and [[(Elixir)]] items that can go straight into a Medical Solution.
# Yellow Supplements will take all your Old Stones happily. Red and Blue Supplements are also usable for common items.
# Rainbow Supplements will take Jewels, which pretty much knocks out all the common drops.
# For equipment, there's usually a way. [[(Metal)]] goes into Electric Orb, and [[(Cloth)]] goes into Medical Solution.

Even more generically, as long as you can get your property onto [[Zettel]], [[Plant Oil]], any Supplement, or [[Distilled Water]], you're totally fine. These items form a loop;
if you need more of an item, you cycle them through the loop for more.

=--PP Boosting Items--=

@r|Dw-iseyFrZU

Tutorial series now includes videos of certain things. This is a simple one but I do
have annotations that attempt to make the system more comprehensible.

If you happen to have PP Frame Maximization on an item, you can skip the first step. Work it onto Medical Solution.

''1.)'' Green Supplement
* Create a Honey using an Ancient Map.
* Get all three Properties. Keep PP Frame Expansion, PP +5.
* Make a Green Supplement using Cactus Palm and that Honey. Keep PP Frame Maximization.
+
''2.)'' Distilled Water
* Work that PP Maximization Supplement onto a Plant Oil.
* Create a Distilled Water using your items that have Traditional Soul and PP Frame Maximization.
* Get all three property levels, keep Synthesis Chain Increase on top of the other things.
+
''3.)'' Medical Solution
* Unlock all its Properties, and be sure to keep Synthesis Skill Frame Increase, on top of your PP Boosting stuff.
+
''4.)'' Transfer everything directly to a Supplement - Rainbow.

And from here, you have all you need to create more PP boosting items as necessary. I will tell you to do some things, but a lot of this stuff is on you.
Also, the other properties mentioned, Synthesis Chain Increase and Synthesis Skill Frame Increase, ARE VERY IMPORTANT. Don't forget them.

=-=

=--Grinding to Alchemy Level 99 (yes, you really have to)--=

The short of it is, spam [[Brother Call|Brother Calls]]. If you need to farm materials, refer to the following:

http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/778830-atelier-shallie-alchemists-of-the-dusk-sea/71413915

Also, believe it or not your inventory has a limit. For generic items, it's effectively limitless. But for "rare" items and anything
you make, you have a limit. So be sure to sell all those accessories once you're done.

=-=

===Equipment===

=--Weapons--=

@r|y8Iga3VvuZA

Annotations for the video go up to Keith's weapon. After that, there's nothing
really new or exciting.

Here are your three Properties:
# Valorous Soul
# Force Soul
# Persisting Attack

Get them onto the following items:
# Halmolium
# Meteonite
# Ayesha: Yggdras

I suggest putting all the properties on a Ziegel Nugget/Aroma Materia/Zettel
before transfering to Halmolium/Meteonite.

Get PP Boosting Traits + Synthesis Skill Frame Increase onto the following:

# Supplement - Black
# Spirit Belt
# Supplement Rainbow
# Old Stone (disassembled from Ziegel Nugget)
# Medical Solution
# Mystix (if you have Escha)
# Ayesha: Nectar Springwater (Dragon Cup disassembly), and you might as well make a second one for Logy.

Get Synthesis Skill Frame Increase on these:

# Gravicrystal / Alto Wood
# Sea Clan's Charm
# Demonkin Ring
# Ignis Gem / Solis Gem
# Mystix (if you don't have Escha)
# Zettel (if you have Solle)
# Polarized Gem
# Flame Bunker

=--Armor--=

@r|uncVCBYCD4I

Like weapons, there are annotations in the video.

Alchemist Set: Awakened Soul, Benevolent Soul, Heroic Soul

Everybody else: Awakened Soul, Evolving Body, Evolves the Body

For this, you have two sets you need to make, and you're going to scatter these things across several items. This recipe
is stolen from Uryvichk, because he keeps posting nice stuff online and I can't unsee it.


''1.)'' [[Handspun Rabbit Yarn]]

* Create with Synthesis Skill Frame Increase, Synthesis Chain Increase, and PP Frame Maximization.
* You'll need a bunch of these.
+
''2.)'' [[Herbal Shirt]]

* Make a [[Moffcot]] using that Yarn you just made, as well as something with Evolving Body (probably via Medical Solution).
* Keep Synthesis Skill Frame Increase, Synthesis Chain Increase, and Evolving Body. Transfer all to your Herbal Shirt.
+
''3.)'' [[Dragoon Coat]]

* Create an [[Unbreakable Glass]] with Traditional Soul and Evolving Body.
* Now make the Dragoon Coat using it and one of your Yarns.
* Keep Evolving Body, Synthesis Skill Frame Increase, Synthesis Chain Increase.
+
''4.)'' [[Mysterious Cloth]]

* Use another of those Yarns and something with Traditional Soul.
* Keep Traditional Soul, Synthesis Chain Increase, Synthesis Skill Frame Increase.
+
''5.)'' [[Velvetis]]

* Make a Supplement - Rainbow or any liquid with Awakened Soul and Evolves the Body.
* Use that, and a Mysterious Cloth, in a Velvetis.
* Keep Awakened Soul, Evolves the Body, Synthesis Skill Frame Increase.
+
''6.) Alchemist Set''

* Basically, repeat all the steps above except #3.
* Replace Replace Evolves the Body with Heroic Soul, and Evolving Body with Benevolent Soul.

%

[[Divine Coat]] @ Max MP, Assist Recovery, Defense, Less Action Chance

: This is only for Wilbell (and a particular Keith build). Spam earth, except Absorb Attribute and Chain Attribute.
:
: You have some freedom on whether you want HP or MP +30, Enhance Rear Regen or Assist Recovery. I suggest MP +30 (if you use [[Star Soul]] on your accessory) and Assist Recovery.
:
: ''1.)'' Dragoon Coat -- Late Addition or Early Addition. The final slot must be any earth skill.
: ''2.)'' Velvetis
: ''3.)'' Handspun Rabbit Yarn -- Add Earth
: ''4.)'' Mysterious Cloth -- Final slot should be Attribute Water or Fire or blank.

%

[[Divine Shirt]] @ Max MP, Enhance Crit, Defense, DMG Cut

: ''1.)'' Mysterious Cloth -- Your choice, earth whatever
: ''2.)'' Herbal Shirt
: ''3.)'' Velvetis -- Absorb Attribute
: ''4.)'' Handspun Rabbit Yarn -- Add Earth, Number+
:
: So, for the free slot in Mysterious Cloth, you have options. You can Chain Fire or you can Chain Attribute. One will get you the evasive set, the other the defensive set. "Vanilla" would be the defensive set, so Chain Attribute.

%

[[Dragoon Mail]] @ Max MP, Enhance Crit, Defense, DMG Cut

: You don't really need to make this (shirts are better except defense), but this section is here if you want it.

: Create a Meteorite Armor with PP Frame Maximization, Traditional Soul. Get all the properties you want onto a Meteonite.
:
: Spam Earth. Be sure to Chain Attribute and Number+.
:
: ''1.)'' Meteorite Armor
: ''2.)'' Meteonite
: ''3.)'' Dragon Bone
: ''4.)'' Dragon Bone

=-=


===Accessories===

You have a loooooot of freedom here. Some things to consider:

* [[Wind Spirit Soul]] boosts critical damage. It caps at 2x damage. Only Stera, Kortes, Jurie, Solle, and Ayesha need this (and only once).
* [[Lord of Night Soul]] boosts crit rates. But it also has a chance of lowering wait speed (quick). It's extremely useful, so use it twice.
* [[Earth Spirit Soul]] increases assist recovery rate. It's good to have twice, though you can probably replace one of them if you really wanted to.
* [[Star Soul]] can work on some characters, as it switches HP and MP. Wilbell will probably benefit the most. Kortes will die with it. Alchemists will become more dodgy with it, but you sort of want them getting hit to trip infinite use Elixirs.
* [[Skill Savings]] and [[Skill Huge Enhance]] are decent filler options. But NEVER on alchemists unless you are specifically building a Mix damage set.
* For stats, you have [[All Stats Power Up]]. I don't generally suggest it, but it's your best raw stat boost.
* As a defensive option, there's [[Holy Soul]] and [[Light God Soul]].

Extremely generically, you can go for this: Earth Spirit Soul x 2, Lord of Night Soul x2, and the last two are your choice.

For the vanilla set, you want Thunder Outfit or Spirit Belt (if no DLC) and Mirage Talisman. Other accessories are for other sets.

You may only need Traditional Soul for much of this section, as accessory properties aren't quite as expensive (33 at the most). I'm going to cover my ass and refer
to PP Frame Maximization. You should have both on thousands of items anyway.


=--Thunder Outfit Synth--=

[[Thunder Outfit|Item Information]]

You have a choice with this one. You can go for pure offense (low fire) or you can select a more defensive setup (middle fire).
I recommend the latter for your alchemists, at least. The main reason you want this is for the low wind effect.

All the items will need Synthesis Skill Frame Increase. Your Meteor should be PP Boosting, and your item properties
should be scattered across Burning Gas and Supplement - Black (offense) or Rainbow (defense). Your final item should be
Stellard Fabric (offense) or Leather (defense). In the event that you want speed, you can use Chain Fire on the Meteor.

Spam earth.

: ''1.)'' Meteor -- Ingredient Zero, Number/Count+
: ''2.)'' Burning Gas -- Absorb Attribute, Add Earth
: ''3.)'' Stellard Fabric / Leather
: ''4.)'' Supplement Black / Rainbow

=-=

=--Mirage Talisman Synth--=

[[Mirage Talisman|Item information]] @ Soul Evolution

You'll need Synthesis Skill Frame Increase on both items you can make, and you'll need to spread
your properties and Traditional Soul through the four remaining slots available.

: ''1.)'' [[Ancient Water]] -- Add Earth, Attribute Absorb
: ''2.)'' [[Dunkelheit]]
: ''3.)'' [[Comet Crest Stone]]
: ''4.)'' [[Old Stone]] -- Whatever, Cost Down 0, Chain Attribute, and either Hidden Effect or Number/Count+, depending on how valuable that 5% burst damage bonus is to you.


This is my older more difficult solution. In the off chance your build costs too much PP, (I
never had accessories go that high, but I don't have an exhaustive list of all PP costs)
this can work for you.

Fill this with earth in every free slot.

: ''1.)'' [[Ancient Water]] -- Add Earth, Attribute Absorb
: ''2.)'' [[Dunkelheit]]
: ''3.)'' [[Comet Crest Stone]]
: ''4.)'' [[Sun Flower]] -- Whatever, Cost Down 0, Late Addition, and either Hidden Effect or Number/Count+
=-=

=--Spirit Belt Synth--=

[[Spirit Belt|Item information]]

Put your properties on a Sun Flower. Synthesis Skill Frame Increase on the others,
PP Boost on something as always. Spam earth.

: ''1.)'' [[Dragoon Coat]] -- Number/Count+, Hidden Effect, Chain Water, Ingredient Zero
: ''2.)'' [[Stellard Fabric]] -- Attribute Absorb
: ''3.)'' [[Handspun Rabbit Yarn]] -- Attribute Earth
: ''4.)'' [[Sun Flower]] -- Earth whatever x3, Cost Down

I don't particularly like any of the fire effects, and the wind effect is more of
an overachiever thing. As long as you get high water feel free to alter this setup
however you like.

=-=

=--Meteor Boots Synth--=

[[Meteor Boots|Item Information]] @ Tireless Legs, Quick Action, Resists Impacts, Speed +25

Put all your properties onto a Meteonite, and have PP boosting and Skill Frame on Velvetis. Or vice versa.

Spam earth.

: ''1.)'' Meteonite
: ''2.)'' Velvetis
: ''3.)'' Giant Triangular Fang
: ''4.)'' Wind Rider Feather -- Add Earth, Absorb Attribute, Chain Wind

=-=

=--Divine Soul Synth--=

[[Divine Soul|Item Information]] @ Images of Light, DMG Absorb

Abrasive should have PP boosting and Skill Frame, Aroma Materia should have all your properties.

You do have some freedom in this setup; spam Wind and absorb attribute on Wind Rider Feather for Solle's set. Earth otherwise:

: ''1.)'' Abrasive
: ''2.)'' Wind Rider Feather -- Add earth
: ''3.)'' Golden Beehive
: ''4.)'' Aroma Materia -- Earth Whatever, Chain Wind, Number+

=-=

=--Heart of Fire Synth--=

[[Heart of Fire|Item Information]] @ Hide Figure, Powers of Light

You need PP on your Supplement and properties on your Cole Medapaids, or vice versa. Spam earth.

: ''1.)'' Slag Heart -- Hidden Effect, Chain Water, Absorb Attribute

===Attack Items===

About Beast King's Blade or Ability Enhancement... BKB is better against the highest level enemies, so a slight edge to it. AE will work well enough if you don't have it.

Most items are better done as Stera due to her access to Double Skill.

Honestly? If you aren't building a special set, just skip this entire section. MAYBE do Living Trash Can.

=--Living Trash Can for Mix Damage--=

[[Living Trash Can|Item Information]]

If you want to use this for debuffs, Carries Heat is the best defense debuff so Defenselessness is pointless to slap on.

ALSO, effect doesn't matter. The properties do. This tutorial is largely for those of you who /have/ to have 999 for some reason.

* Steals Speed, Absorbs All, MP Consume-L
* Can 1: Deadly Strike, Curse of Powerlessness/Slowness/Defenselessness
* Can 2: Consumes Soul, Curses

Recommendation: Make [[Ice Bombs]], disassemble to [[Broken Item]]. Make [[Unbreakable Glass]], disassemble to [[Trash]].

* Broken Item x3
** Skill Frame, Synthesis Chain
** All three of your chosen properties across the other two
* Trash x2
** Skill Frame, Synth Chain, [[Elemental Attribute - Wind]]
** PP Boosting
* Old Stone
** Skill Frame, Synth Chain, Elemental Attribute - Wind
** Twin Color Corundum (LV3 Property) -> Supplement White/Black -> Lightning Bomb or Ziegel Nugget -> Disassemble
* Sun Flower
** Synth Chain

=--Flying Board --=

[[Flying Board|Item information]]

* Blitzkrieg Special / Reduces Critical / Unstable DMG
* V1: Jumbo Blessing, Deadly Strike, Beast King's Blade / Ability Enhancement
* V2: Jumbo Blessing, Property Super Enhance, Beast King's Blade / Ability Enhancement (998 effect)
* 9 slots
* Kinda crummy for being an 'ultimate' item, use if you must.
* Ridiculously complicated synth

This synthesis had me doing backflips trying to figure out how to have my cake... and eat it. V1 is courtesy of whimsic_al, V2 is what I came up with. You can get V2 properties
on a 999 item, BUT you need to farm any PP boosting property (even +3 will work if you are sure to use the Efficiency skill) on Wind Rider Feather / King's Wing. My version is less painful than that.

There are two essential properties -- [[Synthesis Skill Frame Increase]] and [[Synthesis Chain Increase]]. You will worship them.

* Gravicrystal 1 - Synthesis Skill Frame Increase, Synthesis Chain Increase, Beast King's Blade. Use Efficiency to afford the 35 PP.
* V1 Gravicrystal 2 - Jumbo Blessing, Deadly Strike
* V2 Gravicrystal 2 - Property Super Enhance, PP Frame Maximization
** Make sure your Gravicrystals average to 120 Effect (Medical Solution is helpful); you may need to make one with super high effect
* Spirit Belt -  Skill Frame, Synthesis Chain, Traditional Soul
* V1 Burning Gas - Skill Frame, Synthesis Chain, [[Elemental Attribute - Water]] (gives the chain a boost)
* V2 Burning Gas - Skill Frame, Synthesis Chain, Jumbo Blessing
* King's Wing / Wind Rider Feather must be 115+ effect.

If you lack BKB, just use the Property+ skills to get Ability Enhancement.

Generally synth with Stera, and you may need to get creative with synth chain and skill frame usage.

* [[Meteor]], 1 slot 7 use
** Destruction Light, MP Consume-M, Falling Stars, Causes Ailments
** Legendary Destructive Power, Deadly Strike, Beast King's Blade
** Use Leichester Meteorite Iron, Oribis Spiritis, Shelbani Flower, Supplement - Rainbow

===Healing Items===

Both items are worth making, though you don't need an uber Dragon Cup if you don't want it.

=--Elixir Synth--=

[[Elixir|Item Information]]

MP Recovery-XL, Recover KO-L, Cure All, HP Recovery-XXL

No matter what, you want Perpetual Motion and Auto Use, which is an infinite elixir that trips at 60% health. From there, you have some options.

Supposedly, you can do Automatic Activation 50% so the elixir triggers at the slightest hint (though [[Automatic Activation 30%]] is a good, easy to find substitute).
But in the Plus version, when I tried it (50% specifically), I healed for 1 HP. Further, the Plus version NERFS MP Recovery from XL to L, so consider [[Good Medicine]] or even [[Hidden Power of Elixirs]].
Incidentally, I ran with this version of the elixir and still kicked all kinds of ass thanks to Ayesha's healing. Shallies basically kept the party alive.

Or you can put something like [[Goddess' Blessing]], [[Approaches the Gods]], [[Auto Material]], whatever, even [[Soul Dwelling]] if you want. I can guarantee that 60% is enough to keep you alive,
but you need to keep an alchemist in the back at all times just in case, and you'll probably want damage reduction on your accessories.

This recipe was stolen from Uryvichk.

You'll want to get all your properties onto a Super Pure Water. Perpetual Motion is 33 PP, so watch out. If you don't have Perpetual Motion, you
can make it via combining the [[Recycle]] properties, or simply [[Low Energy Mode]] + [[Reuse Resources]].

Your PP boosting should either be Travel Gate or Nectar Springwater.

As for Nectar Springwater, if you're playing as Stera you'll want to jump through this
hoop: you'll need [[Elemental Attribute - Wind]] (Twin Color Corundum
LV3 Property -> Supplement White -> Eyedrops of Truth -> Dragon Cup).
Make a [[Dragon Cup]] and disassemble to get the Springwater of your dreams.

Slight variant: You can make a full wind based chain instead (if you're building
something different) if you put Synthesis Skill Chain Increase on Nectar Springwater.
You will want to avoid Chain Wind, but include Chain Earth and Chain Effect.

Spam Earth.

:''1.)'' [[Nectar Springwater]] -- Equip Frame-, Double Skill (if Stera) or Attribute Wind (if Lotte), earth whatever
:''2.)'' [[Super Pure Water]] -- Add Earth
:''3.)'' [[Dunkelheit]] -- Attribute Absorb
:''4.)'' [[Travel Gate]] -- earth x2, Cost Down 0, Attribute+

%

V2 of this item is courtesy whimsic_al. The properties are much the same, but perhaps consider [[Good Medicine]].

It has Undead Power, Cure All, and HP Recovery-XXL. Can be useful on some sets. Requires Skill Frame on Mysterious Cloth and same Springwater as above.

Spam earth.

:''1.)'' Nectar Springwater -- Equip Frame-, Double Skill, Add Earth, Attribute Absorb
:''2.)'' Contaminated Water
:''3.)'' Dunkelheit
:''4.)'' Mysterious Cloth -- Earth x2, Late Addition

%

Plus Version SUPER REVISION Because Nerfs @ MP Recovery XXL, HP Recovery XXL,
Cure All, with KO recovery from [[Slag Injection]] instead of the normal way.

So your properties are going to be Perpetual Motion, Auto Use, and Slag
Injection (or whatever you like, I guess, but have another KO recovery
item handy!). Mysterious Cloth will have Skill Frame, Traditional Soul,
and one property.

Super Pure Water will have two properties and Elemental Attribute Earth.
Ziegel Nugget LV3 Property -> Electric Orb -> Super Pure Water. Also:
Slag Essence LV3 Property -> Dragon Cup -> Disassemble to Nectar Springwater
-> Multiple options that go straight in Super Pure Water

Spam earth.

:''1.)'' Super Pure Water -- Ingredient Zero
:''2.)'' Dunkelheit -- Attribute Absorb
:''3.)'' Mutated Taun -- Add Earth
:''4.)'' Mysterious Cloth -- Equip Frame-, Order+ 4, Double Skill

Yes, you won't get any Water 2 effect using this. That's why I tell you to
go with Slag Injection.

Thanks to Setsuna for pointing out how to fit Double Skill in there. I
totally forgot Order+ skills existed whoops.

=--Dragon Cup Synth--=

[[Dragon Cup|Item Information]]

Recover KO-XL, HP & MP Recovery-XL.

Works on back row and thus can be used to buff the back row. Level buff is +126.

Get Property Super Enhance, Cost Bonus, Soul Dwelling onto a Stellard Medicine, and PP Boosting stuff and Skill Frame on Distilled. Or vice versa; whatever is easier for you.

Spam wind.

: ''1.)'' Dragon Core -- Skill Frame+, Chain Effect
: ''2.)'' Endangered Herb
: ''3.)'' Stellard Medicine
: ''4.)'' Distilled Water -- Wind whatever x2, Number/Count+, Double Skill (if Stera)

=-=


===Support Items===

Four Beasts is best for max damage sets. Otherwise, it can be replaced easily enough. I put Soul Dwelling on my
Elixir and got by fine, so this stuff is mainly super-optimal.

=--Medicine of the Four Beasts Synth--=

[[Medicine of the Four Beasts|Item information]]

* Forbidden Power, Crit PWR Increase-L
* Property Super Enhance, Jumbo Blessing, High Cost Enhance
* All stats +360, crit power +20%

Here's the ideal (9-slot) version. You'll probably have to property farm off
Prototypes.

Make a Dragon Scale Charm with the PP Boosting properties and Skill Frame.

Spam wind. Be sure to use Equip Frame+.

: ''1.)'' Wind Rider Feather
: ''2.)'' King's Wing
: ''3.)'' Dragon Scale Charm
: ''4.)'' Smech -- Attribute Wind, Chain Effect, Chain Fire

For a more compact setup (no Jumbo Blessing), use Fish Lord to squeeze in Double Skill and Number/Count+ on a 1 slot version.

Honestly? I used a very crummy version compared to this. But if you want max damage, you have to use it.

=-=

=--Traveler's Ration --=

[[Traveler's Ration|Item Information]]

* 1 slot, 6 use
* Quick Digestion, HP Regen-XL, Temp Stamina Up-L, Eat and Recover-XL
* Property Super Enhance, Cost Bonus, Soul Dwelling (81 PP)
* Hits back row, +42 level, max HP buff (200%)
* Preferred over Dragon Cup as primary Soul Dwelling item.

Get PP boost and properties onto Shelbani Flour. Traditional Soul and Efficiency will help. You'll also want Skill Frame.
Outside of that, use Golden Apple and two 3-slot items of your choice. Spam wind, use Chain Attribute.

=-=

=--Time Watch --=

[[Time Watch|Item Information]]

* Cure Slow, Quicken Action
* Property Super Enhance, Cost Bonus, whatever (Perpetual Motion, [[Item Clone]], Soul Dwelling, etc.)
* Alternatively, (instead of using Elixir) move your turn forward every time you're hit with Perpetual Motion, Auto Use, Automatic Activation 50%
* 1 slot
* Only get the hidden effect if you aren't using Medicine of the Four Beasts.

An easy synth, honestly. Try [[Double Foot Component]], [[Glass Tube]], [[Old Stone]] x2. Move Old Stone to rear, add wind, late addition. Spam earth otherwise.
If you use Skill Frame you get to do more stuff, but you can make it with just one Skill Frame. You'll also need to get [[Elemental Attribute - Water]] somehow
if you intend to get the hidden effect. I have faith in you.


=-=

=--Goddess Shield --=

[[Goddess Shield|Item Information]]

* Goddess' Protect-L, Defense Up-L
* Property Super Enhance, Cost Bonus, whatever (Perpetual Motion, Soul Dwelling, [[Crosses Time]], Item Clone)
* Don't use the LV3 property, though. It's weak and overrides the more powerful effect on the item.
* If you're using Medicine of the Four Beasts, don't get either Defense Up.

Old Stone, Comet Crest Stone, Wind Rider Feather x2 should give you enough to work with. Attribute Absorb or Chain Earth
on Old Stone depending on what you need. If you want those extra two uses, well, that's on you. The build is just something
I whipped up super quick in my head, but perhaps replace Comet Crest Stone with Golden Apple and see what the other ingredients
have to offer for your property needs.

=-=

===Debuff/Utility Items===

Lightning Bomb is always worth your time. The rest? Well, if you want.

=--Debuff Lightning Bomb--=

[[Lightning Bomb|Item Information]]

* Blindness, Hinders Movement-M, Wind DMG-L, Attack Power-M
* Property Super Enhance, Cost Bonus, and Carries Heat (56 PP).

You need Synthesis Skill Frame Increase on two items. (One if Lotte.) You have a lot of freedom in where your properties come from, so just do what's easiest.

Make a Bomb, get the LV3 property. Now disassemble for Black Powder. From there: Supplement - Red -> Ziegel Nugget. Disassemble the nugget.

Spam wind.

: ''1.)'' Abrasive - Chain Effect, Chain Attribute
: ''2.)'' Electric Orb
: ''3.)'' Old Stone -- Attribute Wind
: ''4.)'' Supplement - Rainbow -- Wind anything x2, Number/Count+, Double Skill (if Stera)

=-=

=--Chain Building Lava Cube--=

[[Lava Cube|Item Information]]

This is a min damage set, so no 999 effect necessary. As close to 0 as possible is preferable.

* Rain of Fire, Continuous Damage-S, MP Consume-S
* Perpetual Motion, [[Beast King's Blade]], [[Steel Thorns]] (48 PP) (BKB could be substituted with [[Weight of Stones]], I think, as the point is for the extra hit.)
* 15 hits per use. Since items get weaker and weaker with repeated use, you'll get min damage while adding tons to the chain.

You need Skill Frame on one item.

: ''1.)'' Phlogiston - Ingredient Zero
: ''2.)'' Bomb - Attribute Absorb
: ''3.)'' Zettel - Add Earth
: ''4.)'' Supplement - Rainbow -- earth spam, Chain Earth

Be sure to squeak in Equip Frame- in there somewhere.

=-=

=--Globe --=

[[Globe|Item Information]]

Lots of sets. Personally I haven't bothered with this, so these are whimsic_al's notes directly.

* Force of Mountains, Weakens Legs-M, MP Consume-M, Attack Power Down-L
* [[Carries Heat]], [[Carries Cold]], Consumes Soul (40 PP)
* 1 slot, 7 use, multi target, 983 effect

Basically, you need Skill Frame and Synth Chain on [[Golden Blue Staff]] ([[Magia Sumonitora]] can be a non-DLC substitute... with compromises),
[[Zettel]], and [[Sun Flower]]. Scatter the the properties and Traditional Soul as necessary.

Set 2 is much the same, but it looks more like this:

* Force of Mountains, Weakens Legs-M, MP Consume-S, Speed Down-L
* [[Tone of Exhaustion]], Consumes Soul, Property Super Enhance (76 PP)

This time, Magia Sumonitora can be used without penalty.

You can also do a set like the first with Property Super Enhance, [[Multi Enhance]], [[Carries Heat]] (62 PP)

=-=


===Advanced Mechanics===

This section courtesy of whimsic_al.

You don't need to read this unless you're SUPER DUPER INTERESTED.

====Damage====

Have a formula:

* Item Damage = Base Effect * Effect Power Scaling * Property Bonuses * Crit Power * Skill/Item Power * [[Heroic Soul|Heroic Bonus]] * (1 + Burst Power * Chain Bonus) * Level Bonus Multiplier
** For other kinds of damage, kill the property bonuses and effect power scaling. There is a little more to it, but the values are unknown.
** Attack items have an additional problem; multiply them by 1/n, where n = the number of uses. So your first time, nothing changes. The second time, it's halved. Etc. This applies even if you use different copies of the same item.
** Timecards will have the same effect throughout, but use the item again and the timecards are replaced with weaker ones.
** See next section for level information.

You'll find all kinds of base effect powers in the [[Effects]] section.

But let's have an example:

* [[Talisman of Ancient Beasts]] ([[Property Super Enhance|PSE]] / [[Jumbo Blessing|JB]] / [[Beast King's Blade|BKB]])
* "Vanilla" maxed Stera with crit/level buffs. (What's "vanilla"? See [[Build Discussion|this]] section. The short is that it's unspecialized, but powerful.)
* Jurie and Solle Field Bursts
* Lamlost (0 defense), hit once to Burst/Break
* =(1276+325)*2.195*2.64*2.4*2.07*1.08*(1+1.5*1.179)*3.284 = (1276+325)*202 = 450k
* ...But that's not quite right, as the game is fond of rounding. It's likely closer to 420K.

              |                   1000 | 7.072 |

* Property Bonus:
** PSE/ JB / [[High Cost Enhance|HCE]] (9 slots): 3.30 (maximum property bonus, outside [[Legendary Destructive Power|LDP]] and crits)
** PSE / [[Cost Bonus|CB]] / JB (9 slots): 3.23
** JB / PSE / Tier Zero property such as BKB (9 slots): 2.64
** JB/HCE/tier zero (9 slots): 2.62
** PSE / CB / top tier such as [[Soul Dwelling]] (1 slot): 2.32
** PSE / [[Mach Throw]] / Tier Zero, such as a [[Carries Heat]] bomb (1 slot): 1.62

Item properties add effects to items that follow the same scaling/stacking/caps as effects natively found on items. They apply after main effects.
Some effects are capped at 100% bonus from properties. PSE/CB and a 1 slot can hit the cap for these, and JB/HCE are unnecessary.

====Buffs/Debuffs====

Generally last 5 turns, unless specified otherwise. Unlike attack items (on No Hope difficulty), these do not suffer diminishing returns upon repeated use,
so feel free to debuff as much as you wish without penalty. However, buffs from skills and buffs from items do not stack; they will replace each other.
Generally, avoid the skill buffs.

Buffs on KO revival items do not apply to KOed allies. They'll just revive without the buff. This mainly applies to auto-Elixirs, but you'll see it happen.

"Level" increasing buffs from items increase expected damage, as well as attack and speed by 3x the level. (No influence on defense at all.) They stack with regular attack/speed buffs, and they stack additively
with equipment level bonuses (such as from [[Feather Ornament]], [[Mirage Talisman]], [[Thunder Outfit]] and the property [[Awakened Soul]]).
Level debuffs, as you'd expect, decrease expected damage, attack, and speed. Attack/Speed are decreased by 3x the level debuff.

Level buffs on equipment just increase expected damage. Which is still amazing in practice.

Just as an example, if you had Awakened Soul on at level 1, your items would do damage as if you were level 33. You can guess what that does to your attack and speed; it's
actually a bigger increase than if you were to level to 33. Damage increases ~1.5% per level. For instance, Soul Dwelling adds 42 levels and ~61% damage.

* Let's stack!
** [[Shows Illusions]] ([[Thunder Outfit]]), [[Soul Evolution]] ([[Mirage Talisman]]), [[Awakened Soul]] (armor property), [[Soul Dwelling]] (item property) = 228% damage (multiplier in damage formula is 3.28)
** All of the above, minus Soul Evolution = 191% (2.91 multiplier). Hence, Mirage Talisman adds 37% damage at most, and this effect is less than skill power effects from some other items.

====Equipment Effects====

All equipment effects of any type stack additively, including quick chance. They also stack additively with item/skill effects and passives.

* Caps
** Stats: 999
*** Attack and Defense suffer diminishing returns.
+
** Crit chance: 100%
+
** Crit power: +100%
*** Cap can be exceeded in some cases.
*** The first is Solle's Field Burst, which gives +20% crit power.
*** Any items that increase crit power can also surpass the cap.
** Skill power: NONE
*** Will increase the power of items, but only equipment effects; properties do nothing, with the exception of [[Valorous Soul]].
** Damage reduction: 90%
*** Stacks additively with item effects and properties.
** Skill WT: 50%
*** Affects regular attacks, but not items or defense.
*** Multiples with Quick reductions and item/skill effects (such as [[Shorten's Wait]] or Wilbell's Rapid Action).
** Burst Power: ?
*** Jurie's Field Burst increases burst power and stacks additively with equipment boosts.

====Wait Time (WT)====

It's simply a timeline; the timecard is shifted down by an action's WT. Burst is reduced by an amount proportional
to the action's WT, and Kortes's Field Burst reduces this. Assist gauge, rear line recovery, and possibly break
recover in a similar manner.

Turn delay effects have diminishing returns and effectively stop working after the third delay.

Skill/Item WT, quick, and WT reduction buffs are multiplicative. Passives, such as Lotte's
Whimsical Talent (up to 20% reduction), stack additively. However, buffs like [[Shortens Wait]] and
Wilbell's Rapid Action will not stack; they replace each other. Skill WT reduction caps at 50%, and
that can generally be reached (or nearly reached) with a [[Planet Sphere]] (44%). [[Dark God Soul]]
gives a 10% reduction; using two puts almost all skills within the range of a Single Time Watch.

Quick effects have no cap (infinite turns are possible) and can be stacked for 0 WT actions.

Attacking has a WT of 19, and defending has a WT of 15. Everything else is in the skill section.

Among items, [[Lightning Bomb]] is best for most debuffing purposes for its extremely short WT (13).

====Miscellaneous====

* ''Break''
** Different targets have different break thresholds, resistance, and recovery.
** This stuff hasn't been tested extensively. I think whimsic_al is crazy for trying in the first place.
** Breaking with items is glitched; quite often the threshold will be surpassed and reset, ignoring break altogether. This is... okay on higher difficulties, actually.
** Break Addition on items scales with property bonuses, rather than effect power.
** Break increase on equips do not seem to scale with effect power.
+
* ''Assist Recovery''
** Different characters natively have different recovery rates.
** There is a minimum cap to recovery time.
** For most characters, the cap is reached with [[Earth Spirit Soul]] x2 or [[Burns Brightly]] on a 999 [[Divine Soul]].
** Solle, Jurie, and especially Keith are slower than the rest.
+
* ''Ailments''
** To cut to the chase, give the notes in [[Strong Poison]] a read. It is literally the strongest poison and does the most damage per turn.
** Poison damage is based off '''current''' HP.
** Ailment strength scales with effect power and properties, but not in the same way that everything else does.
** Not a lot is known about this stuff outside of that, truth be told.
