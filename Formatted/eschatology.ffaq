The reality of email is that I don't respond to it often. I advise against asking me questions, as chances are I'll see them a week later or so and I
will assume you either figured it out or moved on by that point.

Feel free to leave a note if you want me to respond no matter how late I get to it. This does not guarantee response, but it makes it MUCH more likely.

==Gameplay==

===Synthesis===

(Screenshots will be coming eventually. That should help clear up some things.)

Synthesis starts off very tame; you toss items in, and you get a new thing back. You have no further control. Come back when you can put properties on your items.

I guess, as a first point, any property along the lines of Effect Up is garbage. I guess, if you can't max out the effect value without the property it's okay (limited to early game use only!), but after you max the bar, you aren't gaining anything by piling on more. Since you eventually acquire three synthesis skills that directly raise effect (Effect+), and two more that raise it in exchange for a percentage of your elemental attributes (Absorb Attribute), you should NEVER need Effect Up after, say, the third assignment. And that's being generous; you can max out a lot of items very early.

And, to make it perfectly clear, you want your items to have max effect value so they'll be at max power. The elemental attributes, however, are a separate matter.

Each item has one to four elements and a numeric value attached to /all/ elements. As an example, an Apple has Water with 15 points attached. When you toss this in an item, it will assign 15 points to the water attribute of the item you're creating. To unlock effects, you will need certain elemental values; this varies widely item by item. Sometimes, effects are given to you even with a element value of zero. Most of the time, you have get 15, 30, 60, etc. for a new effect. These effects are not to be confused with the effect value (historically, that was called quality, and that's a better way to think of it).

Sometimes, no effect is better than having one. For instance, some items will drain your MP till you get your elemental value high enough; then the effect disappears. Another thing -- higher doesn't mean better. In fact, when you get the Reset Attribute skill (which brings one attribute to 0), you'll find there are lots of great effects with low element requirements. For most items, though, higher is indeed better. Just not the '''best''' items.

===Battle System===

This is, honestly, a straightforward turn based system. So I'm going to go over some of the less obvious stuff.

In battle, you can support allies by attacking or defending. When you attack, this serves to raise the critical/damage rate; that is, the percentage you see on the screen. There are a few things that can raise the gauge:

* Linca gives an automatic 5% for just being Linca.
* Attacking from the back or side is worth more than attacking from the front
* Critical hits have a bonus
* And, of course, there are items and properties that can influence the rate.

After the gauge passes 200%, you can use a character's special move. I recommend Threia's Catastrophe. It debuffs. (And if you're new to the series, debuffing and buffing actually works.)

There are, furthermore, two additional quirks to the battle system. The first is special moves; any sort of move can raise the special gauge (hitting multiple enemies will raise it even more). If you have 100%, and you use anyone's 200% damage rate skill, you can follow this up with a finishing move. In fact, you can end combos with MULTIPLE finishing moves.

Finally, Escha and Logy get a skill called Double Draw. This attack has two levels, depending on your damage rate. Both levels of Double Draw make your items stronger (and give them different animations), though you should really be aiming for the second skill at all times. Notably, Escha is always the best at finishing. You'll notice, from her skill set and her unique items, that she's set up to do damage, while Logy is more of a debuffer. Either way, they get most of their power from critical damage bonuses.

Certain properties will mention that they boost skill power. This isn't quite true; they boost the power of EVERYTHING up to 100%, including item usage. Only skills themselves can go above the 100% cap. It's really up to you if you want to do a skill heavy set or an item heavy set, but I will emphasize items in my tutorials.

==Walkthrough==

* ''PS Vita Differences''
** The PS3's DLC characters, Miche, Katla, and Wilbell are included by default
** Nio is added as a playable character
** New boss
** A new Lucille event
** New Escha & Logy events
** Japanese voices are free DLC
** You get to see friendship values
** Properties now display which item types they can be equipped to

Who to start with? It doesn't truly matter. However, having access to Escha exclusive items will make uber bosses easier.
This either means creating those items and carrying them over to NG+ (you will have to purchase them, however, at a later
point in the game), or simply taking Escha's route and demolishing everything in your path.

You get either ''Logy's Journey'' or ''Escha's Journey'' for just starting the game.

* ''To get Platinum'':
** As Escha, get the Girl's Association ending. This means finishing the events of Linca, Lucille, and Threia (and thus getting their endings).
** As Logy, get the Men's Association ending. This means finishing the events of Reyfer and Awin.
** Additionally, Escha has two unique trophies, part of Micie's and Clone's events.
** Likewise, Logy has two unique trophies, part of Solle's and Katla's/Harry's events.
** After finishing the game once, you will unlock the true end in your next run.
** The final boss has multiple forms; ranging from level 50 to 99. You have to beat one form that is above level 50, not necessarily the 99 form.
** There are some easier bosses you need to beat.
** Grind to level 99. Not fun, but there are some tricks around to make it easier.
** Otherwise, the trophies should come to you from just playing the game.
+
* ''If you are particularly OCD'':
** Awin's end has two versions and two different pictures. So you'll want to get his end with both protagonists.
** Lucille's end has two versions, one picture.
** Some events are Logy exclusive, some are Escha exclusive. For instance, Reyfer will ask you to make a different item during his events depending on your protagonist.
** The five forms of the final boss? Yeaaaaaahhhhh. I've only seen two forms, but I'm pretty sure there are unique encyclopedia entries for all of them.
** I have all the properties in the game listed, as well as how to get a lot of them.

So, if you're super OCD, you're going to need to shuffle your party around a lot to get all the events on both runs.
It's not difficult, honestly; I did it on my first run.

If not, all you need to do is complete the events of all the dudes or dudettes (that's a technical term), depending on
your protagonist. Since friendship is a hidden value, this means shuffling the ladies around or keeping Reyfer/Awin in
your party most of the time. You also need to pick up the other unique trophies along the way, but these aren't tied
to friendship.

=--Note...--=
There are mistranslations in this game. I fix them (at least, if I catch them I will fix them). So if my info doesn't
match up with what the game says, there's a very strong chance it was a error on acttil's part (that's the localization
company). In particular, Properties are poorly done.
=-=

One final thing. Hidari is my hero; two hotties right in the strike zone! I am, of course, referring to Logy and Awin.
Naturally I feel inclined to share this information with the world.

As a note, not all assignments will be available to you from the beginning, such as those requiring item delivery. But you
can start the others as early as you like, even if they're hidden from you. This game is overall very straightforward; you
shouldn't have a problem completing most of these. You don't need to do all the minor assignments (you only get trophies
for the main goal), but you really should do as many of them as you can. You should totally do the initial nine, whatever
you do, as that gets you recipes and other bonuses.

=--Plus/DLC Notice--=
I kind of just threw the new info in. You weren't exactly meant to see everything in this
bulleted list style, and I think I'm missing some minor things (like a boss or two, and I
certainly haven't updated the appendices for equipment) for the Plus version.
It won't affect your trophies or anything, and I don't believe any of this is missable.

However, I think I have the events. I don't make you any promises in that respect
because I haven't double checked against Japanese sources, but events tend to be
hard to miss in this game.

On top of that, I still haven't updated my equipment tutorials, but I did throw in
steps for the new items.
=-=

You'll quickly be left to explore town. Go ahead and walk around, trip all the scenes... just keep going till you synth
for the first time. Do note that you can use up ALL your items outside town, and you'll get them back when you return to
town. So don't be shy about item usage! In fact, I'm going to put this out here right now: ''Use every single attack and
healing item at least once in battle.'' And keep track of what you've used. This is part of a minor assignment waaaaay
later in the game (so you don't '''have''' to do this), but you WILL thank me later if you're the super completionist sort.

At the Town Entrance, you can gather [[Water]] once a day. At the Apple Orchard, you can gather [[Apple]].

Once you've synthed for the first time, you can press start to quickly travel anywhere. This menu will display icons with
'''''!''''' in them to represent events, so check it every so often to make sure you've tripped all the events you can.
You can't do too much synthing yet; make your Healing Salve and Craft, slap 'em on Escha or Logy via Adventure Equip, and
go out exploring.

* ''Exploration Notes''
** Keep in mind that you can break barrels for items
** The first area you go to actually does have gatherable items, just not the first time you enter it.
** You can enter and exit areas infinitely without wasting time... unless you encounter an enemy or gather something. This is very handy once you unlock field events.
** You can enter the houses in the final area of the forest.

See [[Twilight Forest]]. And I do seriously suggest checking these sections out; it'll help you gather rare stuff and find documents
(you need all 20 for an assignment). For the time being, explore till you fill your basket, then return to Colseit; you can collect
more on a second trip. You have plenty of time to waste, trust me. If time is making you anxious... The final year gives you a single
goal: beat the final boss. Aside from that, you can finish any assignments you missed. Seriously. The year is there just so you can
prepare for the boss, and you don't even need half the time if you don't want to beat its most powerful (level 99) version.

After you finished the major assignment for the term, enjoy Haruka Shimotsuki's singing. Personally, I love the vocal themes in this
game. At some point, you'll get an event with Solle that will open up the request system. Requests get you treats (and rank points,
actually) you'll eventually be using to pay the Homonculi with.

[[Old Highway]] will open up as well. It wouldn't be a bad idea to make a [[Bomb]] first. Once you get there, the game will introduce
Field Events to you. You probably noticed that I listed Field Events in my Twilight Forest section; using certain Events can get you
powerful monsters (which you will not find otherwise), rare materials, and so on. Some of these events are used once, then disappear
(such as "Check relic"), others change the field itself (e.g. "Check rare materials"). As long as you do not leave to the world map,
the field changing events will stay in effect. So you can go from place to place with "Check rare materials" on, and as long as you
don't override it, you will gather rare materials at each area you go to. I may mention you need the max level for a particularly rare
item; you'll make the item required for that later, so don't worry about those items for now.

Once you've unlocked Field Events, be sure to drop back by Twilight Forest to get Documents, and whatever else you like.

=--Note...--=
One Field Event looks like a sheet of paper. This is called "Check Documents". For an Assignment later, you need all 20 documents, but you
might as well grab them as you pass by. So if my area sections ([[Twilight Forest]] or [[Old Highway]], as the two you can go to now) say
there is a document somewhere, or even multiple documents (in which case you will have to repeat the process till you get 'em all), you
should enter and exit the area till you get the check document Field Event.

You can check out what Documents you have by going to your menu -> Journal -> Guide.
=-=

After you've done everything (you WILL have free time), be sure to synth everything you can. In the final 14 days of the term (no sooner!),
if you're done with that, go to Marion to make your final report. Those days will carry over into your next assignment.

=--Note...--=
When you make items, you'll notice they have effects with S, M, and L at the end of the name. These ''DO NOT'' mean Small, Medium, and Large.

Instead, they stand for ''Strong, Medium, and Light''. In short, S is better than L when you're making items.

It's okay if you need to wait a paycheck or two to be able to afford recipe books.

Once you enter Sector One of the [[Southern Ruins]], you'll meet Harry, Threia, and Reyfer. Depending on your choice, either Reyfer or
Threia will join after you finish the assignment. This guide rolls with the assumption that you picked Threia, but if you didn't, her
events more or less switch places with Reyfer's (that is, Reyfer's events happen earlier). Once Reyfer/Threia joins, toss your second
alchemist into the rear.

At some point, before even finishing your assignment, Logy will approach Colland about alchemy equipment. You'll also be introduced
to Research, which you pay for through Marion. These experiments allow you certain gameplay bonuses. Be. Very. Careful. You want money
for recipes. Marion takes your money. Intro to Storage and Search Knowledge are not bad investments, for the moment. You don't really
need more synthesis EXP, combat EXP can wait, and the synthesis bonuses can wait as well. Though maybe a little down the line you can
consider the EXP options to speed things up a little.

A little while after that (I got it after finishing the assignment, but I don't know if that's required), Marion will pop in and give
you a shiny new tool, a Trainer, and the ability to make equipment. Like how I suggest you make every item once, I also suggest you
make all your equipment once. It will be better than your default equips, despite the fact that you can't make the next tier of
equipment yet. Though, I suggest making equipment after you get to Alchemy Level 20. You'll be able to inherit properties from
your materials (this is Very Important) as well as use the Division skill which allows you to put an item in twice, which will
boost your attribute/element level, AND  you get the Quantity LV1 skill, which either increases the number or uses your item has
(Attack/Healing items) or the number of items you produce (everything else).

Pro Tip: Make equipment with Water Resist, Earth Resist, etc. as you see it. Just one per element is fine. It may not be the most "useful", but you will thank me later.

The next thing that happens is that you get access to a blimp, and thus [[Upland Forest]]. You don't need to explore it all during the term; you have plenty of time in the next assignment to get through it; I only made it three areas in, myself. Enjoy the song!

====Friendship Values are Hidden====
''Plus Version Players:'' They aren't hidden for you, but this section is still required reading.

Yep, you read that right. This game has friendship values, but you'll never know what they are.

The way to get friendship up, and thus more character events, is to rotate them into the front line of your party for a while. This basically
means booting your second alchemist to the back row (and later, to reserves) so you can focus on everyone else.

Friendship raises at a rate of .11 per day in the front, .08 in the back, and .03 in reserve (you don't have enough characters to put one in
reserve yet). It will raise any time a day passes, whether you're in Colseit or not. Just remember to shuffle them from time to time.

* If you are playing as Escha, you need all the events from all the ladies. I do not suggest ignoring Awin, as his events unlock a new area. This means you should shuffle four people to the front lines.

* If you are playing as Logy, you need the events from all the dudes. This means keeping Reyfer and Awin in the front most of the time.

* If you're obsessed with seeing everything, you need pretty much everyone's events. It isn't hard, you just have to shuffle your party a lot.

* For the Plus version, or for those of you who paid for Wilbell/Katla/Micie, their friendship events don't count toward endings. (They have non-friendship events as well.)

In the event that my character events don't match up with when you get them, don't freak about it. If
you're early, it means you put your character up front more. If you're late, it means you need to shuffle
your party more often. Just try to stay roughly on track with the events as I list them. It isn't an exact
science, and in many cases I don't even know the earliest you can trip an event. My guide is generally
written as if you picked Threia, though, so Harry's first event appears in the next section.

Since I imagine a lot of you are now playing the Plus version, you'll have half a million characters to
chose from. It is possible to view all their events in a single run. This goes for those of you who bought
all the DLC characters in the PS3 version as well. Here's a table of the friendship values you'll need to
aim for.

| 80 | Awin, Reyfer, Threia         |
| 70 | Lucille                      |
| 60 | Linca, Wilbell, Katla, Micie |
| 0  | Nio, Escha, Logy             |

If you want a full schedule laid out for you, well, I have you covered. But I'd only advise it if you are
extremely paranoid. For the rest of you, just get the general idea and move on with your life.

|*   |* Front                          |* Back                                          |* Reserve                                                     |

| A6 |  Linca (30.8), Lucille (39.6)   |  Reyfer (47), Threia (53), Awin (64.8)         | Alchemist, Nio, Micie (10.2), Katla (28.4), Wilbell (28.4)   |
| A7 |  Linca (44), Lucille (52.8)     |  Reyfer (56.6), Threia (62.6), Awin (74.4)     | Alchemist, Nio, Micie (13.8), Katla (32), Wilbell (32)       |
| A8 |  Linca (57.2), Lucille (66)     |  Reyfer (66.2), Threia (72.2), Awin (80+)      | Alchemist, Nio, Micie (17.4), Katla (35.6), Wilbell (35.6)   |
| A9 |  Micie (30.6), Reyfer (79.4)    |  Threia (80+), Katla (45.2), Wilbell (45.2)    | Alchemist, Nio, Awin, Lucille (69.6), Linca (60)             |
| END | Micie, whatever                |  Katla, Wilbell, whatever                      | whatever                                                     |

You WILL need Micie in the front for most of the remaining year (~268 days). Katla and Wilbell should be at
least in the rear for a little over half the remaining year (~185 days).

I tried to arrange this schedule so that the events for the 'primary' characters would happen around the same
time that they're covered
in the guide, but I haven't verified anything for myself (I used a  different schedule that balanced
the characters a bit differently). This schedule puts off Katla, Wilbell, and Micie
(who have fewer events) till the last minute in favor of the characters that actually matter.

Here are the assumptions: when characters don't join you immediately, you still have 100 days left in the
assignment for them to gain friendship. This is probably off, but just work with it. There's enough wiggle
room that you don't need to be exact (use the last year of the game to fix any issues), so these
calculations are more rough estimates than anything. If you are relatively efficient, you'll find that
the numbers should be quite close.

And do follow the advice about Awin, whatever you do. A9 is extremely boring if you don't get his friendship
to 80 around then.



=--Let's Make Some Attack Items--=
* Required: Level 20 or higher.
* Result: Ice Bomb with Super Destructive, Fixed Increase, Endow Cold.

Do everything you can to increase the Effect. You can use Conversion to Earth for Effect+ LV2 and LV1, as well as Division, and
occasionally Absorb Attribute. Effect Up, the property, will also be helpful, but I do not suggest it in the future. It's actually a
pretty worthless property once you can max out Effect without it.

''1.)'' [[Phantom Saber]]
** Create a Phantom Saber using a [[Garden Stone]]. Keep PP Expansion. Be sure to unlock the Level 3 property (the bottom right box will tell you what the property level is).
** This works because you just combined Inherit PP +5 from the Garden Stone and Inherit PP +3, which is native to the Phantom Saber.

''2.)'' [[Spray]]
** Make using [[Charcoal Pieces]] and the Phantom Saber you just made.
** Keep Destruction Up+, PP Expansion, Effect Up (if you need it -- you can assume the same on future synths)
+
''3.)'' [[Freezing Gas]]
** Use the Spray you just made.
** Keep Very Destructive (Destruction Up+ x Destruction Up), PP Expansion
+
''4.)'' [[Leather]]
** Use [[Sea Bird Egg]], keep Destruction Up++.
+
''5.)'' [[Mixed Lubricant]]
** Use the Leather you just made, keep Destruction Up++, Inherit PP +3.
+
''6.)'' [[Neutralizer-B]]
** Use Spray (Destruction Up+), Mixed Lubricant (Destruction Up++). This is because I personally had trouble getting the last step to work without doing this first.
** Keep Intense Blast, Inherit PP +3.
+
''7.)'' [[Ice Bomb]]
** Use Freezing Gas, Mixed Lubricant, and Neutralizer-B.
** Throw in Mixed Lubricant, use Power+ LV1 on Freezing Gas.
** Throw in remaining items, then use Conversion LV1 on Wind.
** Use Division on Freezing Gas.
** If you need to, use Conversion LV2 on Earth, then Effect+ LV2. Do not use Absorb Attribute; you will lose Endow Cold.
** Keep Super Destructive, Endow Cold, and whatever you like with the remaining points (I had Very Destructive, somehow... not even I know all the quirks to the system).

%

''For a [[Guryun Blitz]]''
** Make a Distilled Water
*** Use Spray (Destruction Up+, PP Expansion), Zettel, Leather, Mixed Lubricant (Destruction Up++, Inherit PP +3).
*** Toss in all items. Use CP Recovery, then Division on Spray. Feel free to use Effect and Absorb Attribute; I did.
*** This should net you Super Destructive, PP Expansion, and Inherit PP +3. My understanding is that tossing in Spray twice also tosses in Destruction Up+ twice, and Destruction Up is the LV1 property to Distilled Water.
** Make Neutralizer-G using that Distilled Water. This allows you to focus on Earth effects.
** Use Blue Gemstone (you may have to use Check collection sharing in Southern Ruins...), [[Shining Crystal]], Cloud Financier (from Solle), Neutralizer-G.
*** Toss in everything except the Shining Crystal. Use Crafting Help on it.
** Use both Conversions on Fire, then Power+ on the Shining Crystal. Toss it in, then use Division on it.
** Keep Wind Core, Super Destructive, and probably Fixed Increase.

''For an [[Omega Craft]]''
** If you have a bunch of Spiky Buds, the easiest way would be to toss those in every slot (at least two slots is required -- the third allows you to use Effect+ LV1 and LV2). Combine this with a Mixed Lubricant (Destruction Up++).
** Toss in everything. Use Power+ on the Lubricant, then use Division on it.
** Now use Conversion as much as possible to Earth so you can use Effect+ LV2 and hopefully LV1.
** Keep Super Destructive. If you want to keep more, you'll have to make a Mixed Lubricant with PP Expansion.

This tutorial is mainly to get you thinking about how to use the system. I used some rather sophisticated techniques to create these items
 but dang it, it's fun to have overpowered items so early. But there will be a follow up one, so keep these materials around.

Also, hang onto the Ice Bomb. You'll want it later.

* ''Plus Version''
** Development Office - Both - Nio joins at the beginning of the assignment. OINK MOOO.
** Atelier - Escha - Marion's concerned about the work Escha is taking. (Escha)
** Atelier - Choice - Escha - Wow Escha, lay off the snack breaks. Five? Really?
** Apple House - Choice - Escha - Nio thinks Escha and Logy get along quite well.
** Apple Orchard - Choice - Escha - Escha's showing off the orchard.
** Atelier - Both - Escha takes on too much work, Marion thinks the two work well together. (Both)
** Administration Office - Choice - Logy - Escha is talking to Solle about Logy.
** Plaza - Choice - Logy - Escha about runs into a fence.

* ''DLC''
** Urban Area - Wilbell: Threia wants to know everything.
** Urban Area - Katla: About finding rare items.
** Upland Forest, Atelier Garden Ruins - Katla: Katla found something interesting.

See [[Withering Plains]]. And I'd suggest finishing up [[Upland Forest]] as well, later in the term. Personally, I bought Search
Wisdom during this assignment to help speed things along.

If you haven't already, be sure to buy the bigger basket from Marion. You may even consider upgrading twice, if you can afford it
after recipes. Search Wisdom is something you want down the line, but Marching Skills is more or less a luxury you don't seriously
need, as air travel is a bigger part of the game than land.

At some point (it only happened after I returned from the village), you'll get Reyfer/Threia in your party. You may put Awin in
the rear, now, which is basically where he should be most of the game.

After finishing the assignment, Marion will give you the Dismantler. This allows you to do two important things.

# You can break apart relics you find into material items. You cannot get these material items through any other means.
# In some cases, you get a recipe for the item you're breaking apart.
+
My area sections detail what you can get, and what the items dismantle into. I'll be sure to warn you about recipes as well.

In addition to dismantling, you'll get a scene and trophy at the Atelier. Logy will be a clean freak (''Scars of the Past'',
and can I just say YEEESSSS), and Escha will be stuffing her face (''Big Eater'').

=--Let's Talk Equipment--=
You can finally make the second tier of equipment. Check out the Property List of all your weapons; at least one of your two
weapons for each character will have both Attack Power 3 and 6. These will combine into Attack Reinforce. You want that.

Another thing. Both Leather and Multi-patch have Defense +3 and Defense +6 for Defense Reinforce. You will need to experiment
to see how you can get the appropriate Property Level for both. You can transfer this to a Mixed Lubricant for an Alloy Plate
and it's easily placed on a Cotton Shirt to create a Sturdy Shirt.

Finally, when you create armor, keep the Wind/Fire/Water/Earth Resist properties as you see them. You'll thank me later.
=-=

=--Some Fun Items--=
Honestly, with the items I already told you about, you don't need anything else awesome. But it isn't a huge stretch to make these mediocre things:

# To make a Lightning Bomb with Super Destructive, make a Capactive Paper using a Distilled Water.
# To make a Living Bomb, probably make Polished Crystal using that Distilled Water.

Just as a comment on that final assignment listed... I tried to read the Japanese and it gave the property name for Healing Up. Not any property you synthesize, just plain-o Healing Up. So I'm inclined to believe, with my baby level Nihongo skills, that the assignment is badly translated and horribly misleading. But I got the assignment automatically, so I can't say anything for certain.

* ''Plus Version''
** Balloon Docks - Choice. Talking about airships. (Different for both, but same topic.)
** Hall - Logy - Choice. Lots of people around.
** Atelier - Escha - Choice. Escha can't handle paperwork.

* ''DLC''
** Plaza - Miche joins.

Right at the beginning, Lucille joins you. Naturally, you'll want to put her up front in your party if
you're playing as Escha or interested in seeing everything. With her comes the Special Support ability. In
short, if you get the damage rate to 200% or higher, you can use a special ability. My favorite is Threia's
because it's a debuff.

Secondly, an event with Solle will finally make the Homonculi available to you. You pay them in sweets to
duplicate items for you; for now, you can have them do simple stuff like Apple Tarts. For an Assignment 9
task, you'll need 50 single slot items. So you don't need 50 Apple Tarts, but you'll want them to take up a
significant portion of them.

Finally, Micie will barge into the Atelier after synthing.

Just a bit of a warning, but there is a boss fight in the next area, [[Abandoned River]]. It isn't hard as
long as you have a semi-decent Omega Craft and upgraded equipment. After beating it, you'll get your first
lithograph fragment. You need five of them to unlock the final boss.

After finishing the assignment, two important things happen. First, you get a trophy (''Powerup Meeting'').
Second, you get Linca. In the PS3 version, it's very important to toss Escha/Logy to the reserve slot.
I mean it. ''Right now.'' You don't have to follow the schedule I laid out before, but
if you learned anything from it, it's that it is important to have Linca in the front for a good amount of time.

Make sure to visit the Balloon Docks to progress the plot. You can give Awin
the proper amount of lumber right now. You may need to buy up Duke's Eiche stock or visit Upland Forest,
though. There's also a scene with Katla. If you're on NG+, you can afford the book at 100,000 Cole (even
with Dunkelheit, it's not a good value!), but you'll eventually get it for free if you keep waiting.

=--Money Money Money--=
Now you can afford anything you want easily. Just follow a few simple steps. This is modified from
''Illusionbreaker's'' topic on GFAQs.

[[(Liquid)]] x2

** Make two Leathers. The first is made with Soft Leather (High Price), and the second with Quality Fur (High Price+).
** Make a Distilled Water using a Silver Hive (High Price++) and Leather (High Price+). Use Division on Silver Hive. Keep Rare Goods and High Price++.
** Make a Mixed Lubricant using two Leathers with High Price and High Price+, keep High Class Item.

[[Purple Crystal]]

** You will need the LV2 properties from both upcoming items. Not too difficult. Without either, you will not be able to afford High Price++.
** Make a Crystal Ball using the Mixed Lubricant. Keep High Class Item and Inherit PP +3.
** Make a Purple Crystal using that Crystal Ball and the Distilled Water. Use Division on the Distilled Water. You will probably need to use CP Recovery to do this. Keep Premium Price, Rare Goods, High Price++.
*** So why use Division on that water? You want its properties to be included twice. Use the system's quirks in your favor!

Enjoy. You'll want to get your Homunculi duplicating this in their spare moments so you can afford all the experiments. It's better to put
one crystal per slot as opposed to multiple crystals in one slot. At max Effect, I was selling these for 4620 each.

As for experiments, I'd prioritize storage and time savers, then combat related stuff, then alchemy stuff. Oh, and be sure to squeeze in
Homonculi experiments from time to time.

=-=

=--The Best Lava Cube--=

I'm going to assume you know how to get Super Destructive using a Capacitive Paper and a Bomb. You need to be level 33 or higher to pull
this off (you get the skill Perfect Division).

If you're too low, go ahead and make the item so it has Falling Stars (you need the highest earth effect), and remake it ASAP.  (I had to
make the item to get up to level 33, and this is after buying up all exp boosters from Marion).

* Ingredients: Phlogiston, Bomb, Capacitive Paper, White Neutralizer.
* Put Phlogiston, Bomb, White Neutralizer in.
* Use Power+ LV1 on Capacitive Paper. Put it in, then use Perfect Division to put it in again.
* Use Division on Bomb or Phlogiston.
* Enjoy your Lava Cube.

This synthesis isn't particularly hard, but the "correct" ingredients aren't particularly obvious.

Remember how the game told you to put Meteor on your Cube? It meant Falling Stars. Also, both of the fire Effects are called Inflicts Burns,
but their descriptions are different. I made sure you got the better of the two.

If you're playing the Plus version, they actually corrected both errors regarding this item.

===Assignment 5===

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... professional localization:

: "A place so full of slugs, apparently, that the excavation isn't making any progress at all."
: "So we have to go fight the slugs too? That sounds kind of difficult."
: "Yes, according to the information, there are eyewitness accounts of a humongous slug."

Better bring the salt!

Truth be told, the mistranslations are part of my motivations for writing this guide. Even if you didn't notice any of them yourself
(look at the properties, if you're ever in doubt), you probably saw me discussing some of them. I don't want to sound gripy, but I know
acttil can do WAY better.

Also, these lines were fixed for the Plus version, so no salt for you all. And (Sting) was corrected to (String). And maybe other minor
stuff I haven't delved into. I'm a bit happier, but the properties are still messy.

** Katla event at Slag Graveyard / Graveyard Center -- Talking to slags
** Wilbell 30 friend - Urban Area - Wondering about Ayesha.

* ??? wtf is this new
** Lucille event with Solle at Administration Office. Paying homunculi.

See [[Slag Graveyard]].

At some point, you'll get the Linked Attacks, Linked Guards, and Linked Specials experiments. I strongly suggest them, when you can afford it.
You also get Materials, which is a synth skill. If you're on NG+, that really expensive (100,000 Cole) experiment allows you to buy your equipped
adventure items from your previous playthrough.

Katla will try selling the book for 2000 Cole. You can be cheap and say no. You can't make the item yet anyway, and Harry will give it to you at
the Town Entrance later.

There is a boss fight at Graveyard Core. I had the second tier equipment on, as well as the Lava Cube I mentioned earlier (along with Omega Craft).
I whooped it, no healing items necessary. You will want to attack debuff with Threia, regardless, as well as do any other debuffs you can. I was level
27. Afterward, you get a second lithgraph piece.

During free time, you'll get an event and song at the Hall.

You are welcome to make a [[Music Box]] as good as you can make it, but if you don't care for that item, make it with Terrible
Tone (the lowest wind effect). You will thank me later.

=--More Synthesis--=
Don't bother making the ~best~ Eis Ice Bomb right now. Soon, but not now. (Well, technically nothing I'm telling you to do is optimal.)

So instead, let's make a Roten Blitz.

''1.)'' [[Iron Plate]]
** Use a Capactive Paper with Super Destructive.
** Keep Super Destructive. You are free to make this property on the Roten Blitz using Black Neutralizer, if you want.

''2.)'' [[Roten Blitz]]
** Ingredients: Ifrit Breath, Iron Plate, Wood Chips, Black Neutralizer.
** Use CP Recovery as needed.
** Toss in Ifrit Breath. Use Power+ LV1 on Wood Chips, then Division to toss it in again.
** Toss in Black Neutralizer, Iron Plate. You may need to use Crafting Help LV3.
** Use Quantity LV2 if you have it, whatever else you like.
** Keep Flame Core, Super Destructive. I didn't plan for a third property, so alter this as you like if you have one you want.

In the Apple House, you'll get a plot-related event with Clone. You'll be seeing a series of Bumblebee Princess events. The Apple Orchard event
is also plot-related, and you get [[SP Fertilizer]].

See [[Searing Wastes]]. I recommend visiting it in two chunks, just so you don't feel too upset that you have to go back for almost nothing. Wilbell
will be the one directing you back in that direction, as part of the plot after making the Flight Gas Jar (you need Buoyant Gas from the wastes to make it). You'll need to visit a new area in the Wastes... to basically be kicked out again by the '''Fire LOOOORD'''. After consulting Wilbell *again* for the [[Element Core]] recipe, you can progress that part of the plot. You should absolutely have a [[Heavenly Spirits]] before going back; it instant-warps you back to the Atelier.

After you visit Withering Plains, you can enter the well at [[Village Well]]. Do so for a Lithograph Piece and document.

From now on, if you have an idle moment, make a Mystery Lantern. You need to reduce its equip cost to one slot (the wind skill, Compress, will do this),
and preferably increase its uses as much as possible AND you want the best effect. You'll want about 20 uses, in total, for high end synthesis.

As for Plant Nutrients (I dearly want to call it a Tonic, thanks to older games), make your first one crappy as you like. But for your personal use, make
one with the best effect, and as many uses as you can cram on it. Using Plant Nutrients allows you to gather rare items. Combined with "Check rare
materials", you'll be gathering "max" level items that are typically hidden to you.

You should be about at Alchemy level 37 at the moment. Once there, you've reached your final skill (Reset Attribute). Any others must be bought from
Marion as experiments.

You do have a boss fight at the Slag Graveyard waiting for you. It isn't much trouble though, especially not after making Titan Hammer, and Eis Ice
Bomb, among others.

=--Warning!--=
You will be able to make the Flight Gas Jar after going to Searing Wastes. You are encouraged to do this, as you get a trophy (''Future Dreams'') and
the Double Draw ability, which is totally awesome to use in battle (just try it out, and be sure to get the damage rate over 200%).

Anyway. ''DO NOT LEAVE COLSEIT.'' Honestly, I never got Awin's events to disappear in my own testing. But be cautious. View his events before wandering
off, and you might as well stick around for the other plot events.

Failure to comply may result in missing an entire dungeon. Or maybe it won't; I've heard that Lucille can unlock the dungeon for you, but I have never
skipped this event to try.
=-=

=--More Synthesis--=

The following are less about the properties (I leave that to you) and more about the effects.

[[Eis Ice Bomb]]

This requires disassembling a [[Demon Eye]] from Searing Wastes for an SP Neutralizer. You will need all of your traits to be on a Ice Bomb.

** Ingredients: Water Crystal, Ice Bomb, [[Bubbling Water]] (mainly for Earth skills; feel free to modify), SP Neutralizer
** Toss in everything but your Ice Bomb.
** Use Conversion LV1 on Fire, then Power+ LV1 on Ice Bomb. Use Crafting Help LV2 on Ice Bomb, then Conversion LV2 to Wind.
** Toss in your Ice Bomb, then use Perfect Division to toss it in again.
** Use Conversion LV3 to Wind, then use Division on Ice Bomb.
** Finally, use Reset Attribute on Water.
** And now you've seen why Reset Attribute is useful. Enjoy your Bomb.
** Keep Super Destructive, Endow Cold, and Count Boost or whatever you like.

Yes, this item takes your MP. There's no avoiding it.

%

[[Titan Hammer]]

Zero wind. Lots of water and fire. I used Purple Crystal, Iron Plate, [[Antique Moss]], and Slag Memory. With Power+ LV1 on the Slag Memory. That
should be all you need to get started.

** Administration Office - Choice - Logy. Escha isn't using her intelligence on reports.
** Dragon's Fist Tavern - Choice - Logy. Solle eats too!
** Atelier - Choice - Logy. Do not disturb Escha.
** Atelier - Choice - Escha. Figuring out the tablet.
** Atelier - Choice - Escha. Still griping about paperwork!

See [[Dragon's Nest]]. You should get a Diamond Gemstone before leaving. The final piece of the lithograph is here, by the way. Also, see [[Ruins Altar]] and [[Crumbling Altar]].

In the Administration Office, you get a plot related event about a metal eating dragon, which is followed up with an event at the Dragon's Fist Tavern and
another at the Hall (you get [[Dragon Repellant]]). Long story short, they're going to suggest that you scare it away. Well, if you want to do everything,
you're going to have to kill it, and you might as well kill it sooner than later. You are very capable of doing it during this assignment. Basically, this
dragon is the prerequisite to fighting a stronger dragon at the end of the game. For the record, I forgot to equip Escha with attacking items, threw her in
my party (she was useless!) and STILL beat the thing. It's not as hard as the game makes it out to be, but I still suggest being more prepared than I was.

With Clone, you'll get the next chapter of her story. Finally, you'll get an event with Nio. If you haven't played Ayesha, uh, go play it now. I'll wait. :P
Seriously, all the scenes with Nio tug at the heartstrings.

The boss of this assignment... honestly, I left Escha behind just as an experiment. And I used all the items I suggested you make up to this point. Absolutely
everything was from the previous assignment. And I won. If you have inferior items than the Super Destructive stuff I've been telling you to make the entire
game... throw Escha/Logy in your party and try out Double Draw, with your best item going last. Try to have Threia debuff as well using her special support.
One thing, though. The boss does have little missiles he likes to launch at you. They're a timed effect and you can't defend against them, so make sure you're
at decent health when he launches 'em.

** Adminisration Office - Choice - Escha. Solle said it was perfect!
** Balloon Docks - Choice - Escha. Use that airship.
** Apple House - Choice - Logy. Nio wants to show that old geezer.
** Apple Orchard - Choice - Snoozing / Going to central. A bit different for both.

* ''DLC''
** Micie - Plaza - Quit growing taller. 30 friend.
** Micie - Plaza - He's not indimidating enough.

You know the drill. Trip all the events you see. You should continue the book with Clone and get a plot event with Nio.

Note that Nio has a Dunkelheit. It's expensive, but it's also a really good material. You can, however, gather these for free at [[Lab of Eternity]] and
[[Southern Ruins]]. You will need a Plant Nutrients. And note that it's rare; if you want to farm them, you'll want to save first.

Before you leave, make the airship parts. You can do it after buying the new recipe from Nio, especially if you followed my instructions and got a
[[Diamond Gemstone]]. The big reason you want to do this is because you will travel faster through the air.

Yeah, this section is pretty empty. The fun stuff starts in the next assignment, so, uh, enjoy the break?

Okay, there are some REALLY DUMB assignments here. Some of them are impossible on a first run. But no worries! You have over a year to accomplish all these
tasks. You aren't meant to do them all within the assignment, so don't.

As I'm sure you noticed, there are a lot of events to do. The plot related ones are in the Apple Orchard.

Once you get the initial nine tasks done, you really don't need to go out of your way to do more. You'll naturally get to most of them by the end
of the game, and the rest are optional bosses. If you're behind on your item using one, though... good luck.

After you get the event with Awin, see [[Ends of the Earth]]. STOP. There are two bosses there. You're too weak on your first run. Feel free to
explore, just be careful. You can dodge them both.

====I Have Too Much Free Time====

Yes, you should have boat loads of time. And I'm quite happy to tell you what to do with it. You see, ultimate synths are a serious time investment,
so you might as well get crackin', on some of the prep stuff that you can do now. Even if you're interested in suboptimal stuff, you should still do some of this.

You will need to stop by [[Preparation for Ultimate Items]]. You don't have access to the Fallen Ruins, so you can only do Searing Wastes, Lab of
Eternity, and PP Boosting Items. Unfortunately, some ultimate properties are not naturally available on any items; you must use the relic method
to get unique properties. Lab of Eternity's Properties are particularly nasty, and you don't have the ability to make maximum use Mystery Lanterns
yet. However, if you have a lot of free time it's worth it to get started on the Lab's properties. Trust me. I had 20 uses and did okay with some well placed saves.

If you STILL have nothing to do, uh, I guess you can start some ultimate synth stuff. You just can't complete most of it.

Or you can level grind. You need to get to level 99 for a trophy. Honestly, though, I'd wait for ultimate equips to do this.

FIRST AND FOREMOST, make sure you have all the lithograph pieces. If you don't, get them now. They are mandatory, and the final boss will not
appear without them.

Duke's event will unlock an optional boss. If you haven't beaten the dragon in Dragon's Nest (the one you could scare away instead), you need
to do so now to unlock this new boss.

If you're wondering what the (!) points on the map are, they represent bosses.

You can now enter the Unexplored Ruins. ''STOP.''

# If you want to see it, go get the bad end now. Don't enter the dungeon and fly around the world map till time runs out.
# You will get the [[Elixir Base]] relic there. I got it by using a Dowsing Rod in the first area. It's one of the very few missables in the game. Though if you have the free DLC or Plus version, you have another chance at the Palace of Paupers.
# You are much less likely to miss this, but there is an enemy called [[Tracker]] that you can only find in the Floating Ruins.
# Notice that I did not create a proper location section for this place. There is a Good Reason for that... it turns into the [[Fallen Ruins]] after you beat the boss at the end.
# There is nothing the Unexplored Ruins has, except Elixir Base and [[Tracker]], that the Fallen Ruins doesn't.
# There are two bosses (Areas 3 and 5), so come prepared. Preferably with the shiny new items the game gives you; a decent Knowledge book or Tauzent Blitz will do nicely.
# I've heard some of you are using ultimate items to beat the second boss. That's mega overkill. My armor used Defense Surge, DEF/SPD Up, and Defense Reinforce. Accessories were just random crap thrown together. Weapons tended to have Skill Reinforce and Attack Reinforce. Just be sure to debuff the boss with at least an Airto Blitz. The longer the fight goes on the more likely you are to lose.
# Escha's hat regenerates.

Once done, you'll get some plot events. There are different scenes for Escha and Logy. There is also a Logy exclusive event at the Atelier in which he receives a letter.

Once you unlock the [[Fallen Ruins]]...

# Be sure to get a Sky King Fossil. You will need to walk ALLLL the way to [[Area 4]] to check rare materials, then back to [[Area 1]] or [[Area 2]] and use a Plant Nutrients. It's rare, too, so this may require several attempts and your items don't regenerate after you leave. I suggest not gathering anything and just use Plant Nutrients on your way back.
# Flameu is in [[Area 5]]. You can break honeycombs along the way; these raise her level by 15, 10, 10, and 14. Breaking just one and defeating her will suffice for the trophy, if you're terrified of her level 99 form.
# If you are an OCD completionist, you will indeed need to fight her five times for all five encyclopedia entries. (At least, I believe she has five; I have only seen 50 and 99, myself.)
# Logy and Escha have different scenes with Flameu.
# Colony Collapse Disorder is a great song. Yes, the final boss theme.

=--Flameu--=

For the level 50 version, she's actually pretty easy. Bring a decent Tauzent Blitz or Knowledge Book, preferably the Elixir Base described
[[ Elixir Base|here]], and you will stomp her. I did it with decent equipment at the second to last tier. Not having the auto-Elixir Base would
just prolong the battle a little bit, so you'll be fine if you have a normal Elixir/Elixir Base on both alchemists. She's not hard, I promise.

For the level 99 version, you'll need to see [[Advanced Synthesis Tutorials|Advanced Synthesis Tutorials]]. I did this at level 60, but I
imagine you could do lower. Be sure to "Fix the mistake"

* ''Helpful Items''
** Knowledge Book. I only got to use it on her twice, after setting up.
** Demon Crucible. Gives Escha three moves in a row. This appears in the synthesis tutorial; you don't need to make it uber, but do follow the fifth step so you have the effect you need. It's rather difficult to get.
** Goddess Shield. You'll need it at the end when Flameu powers up.
** Time Watch. Speed and auto revival are never a bad thing.
** Command Chime. So you can use Goddess Shield/Time Watch on everyone at once.
** Poly. Poison. Flameu has a huge buff on herself; you'll want this and Threia's special support attack.
** Elixir Base. And at least a revival item on your other alchemist just in case.
** I will note, it's seriously better to create uber attack items and blast her away before she can do anything, rather than bother with all of the above.
=-=

In the final year, on 1/1, you'll get an event about a new title for Clone's book. Probably an Escha exclusive.

====Endings====

On the final day, you'll get either ''Escha's Rest'' or ''Logy's Rest''. Be sure to equip everything you want to carry over (your adventure equips
can be bought at a later point; your regular equipment will immediately carry over along with your cash), and sell everything else.

You'll be given some options. (The bad end gives you some options too, by the way.)

*  See Them Off / Return to Central
** Make a promise (Welcome Home) -- NG+ Only
** Bid farewell (A Smiling Departure) -- Automatic on first playthrough
*  Find a new life
** Big Brother / Arwin (Over the Hill), this end has two versions, two images. And yes, seriously, Arwin.
** Threia (Deadline Approaching!)
** Reyfer (The Thrill of the Hunt)
** Lucille (Dr. Lucille), this end has two versions, one image.
** Linca (Each With Their Own Strengths)
*  (Escha) So hungry... (Girls' Association)
*  (Logy) Aim for a great career (Men's Association)

As a final, personal note, I would appreciate it if you would recommend my guide using the lovely green "yes" button that follows you around.

You can get the Demon Eye relic here. I suggest it, as I'm going to do a tutorial assuming you have the SP Neutralizer it disassembles into.

Be sure to get at least one Diamond Gemstone here! (You'll thank me later.)

This is where the boss is. Fighting it is optional, but I suggest you fight it ASAP so you can fight another optional boss later on. You can fight it later if you need to.

==Advanced Synthesis Tutorials==

===Preparation for Ultimate Items===

The first two steps are the really grindy, luck based part of ultimate items. To do this, you need to...

# Find a map that has Check relic change.
# Go to another map that has Check relic and use Dowsing Rod (with Amazing Relics).
# Then spam Mystery Lanterns (with Search Up S) till you get a relic with the Property you want.

=====Searing Wastes or Dragon's Nest=====

There are a couple things you need here. I would make them all Ziegel Nuggets; that's where I had luck getting both properties. Melty Metals may work as well.

|* Properties          |
| [[Enhance Body]]     |
| [[Cost Bonus]]       |
| [[Traditional Soul]] |
| [[PP Maximization]] (Optional) |

I do not know if you can find Enhance Body at Searing Wastes (it also happens to be somewhat rare).

# Go to Crimson Cliffs for Check relic change. Get gauge as high as possible.
# Reenter the Cliffs, use Dowsing Rod, happy hunting.

Alternatively, and perhaps as a better option:

# Check relic change at Dragon's Left Wing
# Then get the relics at Dragon's Head.

=====Lab of Eternity =====

Go to Entrance for Check relic change, then go to Herb Garden for the actual relics. Again, Dowsing Rod.

There may be a lot to get here, but only the last two or three should give you any trouble. It took me two trips (with some save abuse).

You want Natural Extracts.

|* Properties   |
| [[Sunlight Soul]] |
| [[Moonlight Soul]] |
| [[Light God Soul]]                                       |
| [[Robust Body]]                                          |
| [[Persisting Attack]] or [[Expert Technique]] or both    |
| [[Dark God Soul]], [[Night Lord Soul]], or [[Wind Soul]] |
| [[All Around Boost]]                                     |
| [[Auto Material]]                                        |
| [[Mach Throw]]                                           |

4-God Attack can be synthed into an item easily, so it's optional. If you see it, consider yourself lucky.

Mach Throw is rather important, so be sure to duplicate it if you don't wind up with a bunch of 'em.

=====Fallen Ruins =====

You get both Check relic change and Check relic in [[Area 1]]. You want Green Crystals.

|* Properties                     |
| [[Evolve Body]]                 |
| [[Super Properties]]            |
| [[Jumbo Blessing]]              |
| [[Mach Throw]]                  |
| [[Brave Soul]]                  |
| [[Warlord Soul]]                |
| [[Loving Soul]]                 |

If you already got Mach Throw at Lab of Eternity, don't worry about it. Perpetual Motion is also something
that is easily created.

Before I go on...

http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/709407-atelier-escha-and-logy-alchemists-of-the-dusk-sky/69432083

This is a better build than what I describe. Mine uses slightly older information. I haven't beaten the
strongest DLC boss with this set (you should keep the items largely the same), but everything else goes
down handily. In any case, the synthesis steps are the same, but the properties can change. Read
that if you're interested. Awakened Soul is a mega pain in the ass to find, but my experiences in Shallie
tell me properties like that are mega amazing.

(Part of the reason I never beat that boss is becaue I refuse to grind above 65... and the other part is
probably minor equipment issues.)

====PP Boosting Items====

If you got a PP Maximization Ziegel Nugget, skip to step 3.

''1.)'' [[Concealing Skin]]
** No ingredient should have PP +3.
** Feel free to use Effect+ LV3.
** Keep Inherit PP +5. This is the LV3 Property.
+
''2.)'' [[Medical Solution]]
** Use Trio Taun (PP Expansion) and Concealing Skin.
** Keep PP Maximization.
+
''3.)'' [[Iron Clay]]
** Use Ziegel Nugget (Traditional Soul), keep Traditional Soul.
** If you got a PP Maximization Ziegel Nugget, throw BOTH your items with Traditional Soul and PP Maximization and keep those traits.
+
''4.)'' [[Neutralizer-G]]
** Use Trio Taun (PP Expansion) and Medical Solution (PP Maximization). Keep both.
** If you got the PP Maximization Ziegel Nugget, all you need is PP Expansion.
+
''HENCEFORTH, TRY TO USE BOTH QUANTITY SKILLS.''
+
''5.)'' [[Moon Tablet]]
** Use Iron Clay and Neutralizer-G. Keep PP Maximization, PP Expansion, Traditional Soul.
+
''6.)'' [[Comet Crest Stone]]
** Use Moon Tablet. Yes, the one you just made. Keep everything on it.
** Take care to not have PP Enhancement on anything.
** Get your Homonculi busy duplicating this. Just do a bunch of requests for one item.
+
''7.)'' [[SP Neutralizer]] with the Comet Crest Stone. Keep all its properties.
+
''8.)'' [[Cardboard]] with the SP Neutralizer. Keep all its properties.
+
''9.)'' [[Distilled Water]] with the Cardboard. Yada yada, you get the point now.
+
''10.)'' [[Medical Solution]] using Distilled Water.
+
''11.)'' [[Colseit Fiber]] using Cardboard.
+
''12.)'' [[Ziegel Nugget]] using SP Neutralizer
+
''13.)'' [[Iron Clay]] using Ziegel Nugget.
+
''14.)'' [[Automatic Drive]] using Iron Clay. Try to use Compression.
+
''15.)'' [[Magic Fiber]] using Colseit Fiber.
+
''16.)'' [[Treasure Grimoire]] using Cardboard.
+
''17.)'' [[Dragoon Cape]] using Colseit Fiber.

Remake or duplicate anything that you're low on. Moon Tablet is a notable one.

===Ultimate Weapons===

First of all, boosting skill doesn't just apply to skills. You get up to 100% boost for all non-skill attacks (including item use!). Skills themselves don't have a cap on how much they can be boosted. Therefore, you want 100% boost in the form of Brave Soul for your alchemists. No more, no less. The next point, for alchemists, is that a lot of their power is derived from crit boosts and crit bonuses. You are free to use properties of your choice in this tutorial (I'm never going to nag you much about stuff -- you can follow the original tutorial exactly and beat the tar out of the final boss!), just keep those points in mind if you do.

This tutorial is modified from jinhaoyu122's original topic to have better traits, as given by afreaknamedpete. I would like to mention, though, that all of the equipment is still a work in progress; I think a few items may need tweaking.

* ''End Result''
** Escha/Linca/Lucille: [[Brave Soul]], [[4-God Attack]], [[Absolute Senses]]
** Logy/Threia/Reyfer: Brave Soul, 4-God Attack, [[Warlord Soul]]
** Awin: Brave Soul, Absolute Senses, Warlord Soul
* ''If you want a simpler setup'' try the following on ALL equipment:
** 4-God Attack, your choice of [[Persisting Attack]]/[[Skillful Attack]]/[[Brave Soul]]/[[Expert Technique]].
** The same tutorial applies, except that you only need one Ziegel Nugget.
** I will suggest [[Absolute Senses]] + [[Brave Soul]] on alchemists, whatever you do.

What's the difference? One packs a normal punch, but the first is specialized for Double Draw usage. Basically, the first setup, combined with the rest of this tutorial, will allow you to almost one shot the final boss. Yes, the level 99 form.

Personally, I don't know if Warlord Soul is strictly necessary on Logy. But I'll roll with it. afreaknamedpete didn't quite specify a great set for Reyfer, but he seems to have a similar role to Threia... which is to say, he's more useful for his special support skill.

What about the other four characters? Good question! I'm not willing to do the experimenting on which is best, but here's your generic options: make 'em like Lucille/Linca and only use NORMAL support attacks, or only use SPECIAL support attacks and use the Threia/Reyfer set.

You will always want to use Quality skills, nd often Quantity. I may occasionally tell you to do so, but it's really on you to keep it up.

''1.)'' [[Ziegel Nugget]] (many of them)
** You'll basically need a Nugget for each of the setups listed above.
** If you see a shortcut, go for it.
** Create [[White Neutralizer]] x3, with one property each: Brave Soul, Warlord Soul, and Absolute Senses ([[Sky King Fossil]]). Then synth Neutralizer-R using [[Dragon Core]] (4-God Attack).
** A cute feature of Ziegel Nugget is that it can take itself as an ingredient. So start off by creating a Ziegel Nugget with Brave Soul.
** Make a second Ziegel Nugget using the one you just made and a supplement with 4-God Attack. You will need a PP Boosting Iron Clay from here on.
** Make a third with Warlord Soul. You've now finished Logy/Threia/Reyfer's nugget (Warlord Soul/4-God Attack/Brave Soul). Be sure to use both Quantity skills.
** Make one more nugget containing the properties for Escha/Lucille/Linca.
** Awin doesn't need Absolute Senses on his Nugget because Sky King Fossil is required for his weapon. He can thus use Logy's nugget and save you a synth.

''2.)'' [[Humming Quasar]]
** Use the Ziegel Nugget (Brave Soul, 4-God Attack, Absolute Senses) and a PP boosting Comet Crest Stone (or Moon Tablet; just be sure to max all elements out for the weapon's effects)
** Use a Quantity skill. (This isn't 100% necessary, just be careful in the next step. It may help you for DLC characters too.)

''3.)'' [[Lifetree Staff]]
** Create a [[Golden Wing Staff]] using that Humming Quasar. (I guess a Ziegel Nugget would work too.)
** Create a [[Spirit Garland]] using a PP Boosting Colseit Fiber. Keep its properties.
** Toss both of those into the Lifetree Staff. Keep 4-God Attack, Absolute Senses, Brave Soul.
** ''Use a Quantity skill.'' This is necesssary. (Maybe two depending on your Wilbell build.)

''4.)'' [[Traveling Doctor]]
** Use PP Boosting Medical Solution (for all elements!)
** Make a [[Teak Basket]] using the Lifetree Staff as Lumber.
** Now directly transfer to the Traveling Doctor. Keep 4-God Attack, Absolute Senses, Brave Soul.

''5.)'' [[Brave Bunker]]
** Use any Ziegel Nugget with Warlord Soul and Brave Soul, as well as PP Boosting Comet Crest Stone.
** Keep Warlord Soul, Brave Soul, Absolute Senses.

''6.)'' [[Holy Talisman]] and [[Proto Phantom]] both will take a (Metal) directly.
** Feed them the Ziegel Nugget with Warlord Soul, 4-God Attack, and Brave Soul.
** For Proto Phantom, consider using Time Flower, Dunkelheit, or Sun Flower to max all elements.
** You will need a PP Boosting Comet Crest Stone and Dragoon Cape.

''7.)'' [[White Feather 9]]
** Create a [[Silver Arm]] using a Ziegel Nugget with Warlord Soul, 4-God Attack, Brave Soul and a PP Boosting Iron Clay.
** Use a PP Boosting Colseit Fiber or Cardboard. You know what to keep.

''8.)'' [[Meteor Broom]]
** Either use a Life Tree Staff in [[Precision Broom]], or Ziegel Nugget -> Iron Clay -> Moon Tablet.

''9.)'' [[Peerless Sabre]]
** Make a [[Cross Rapier]] using a Humming Quasar or Ziegel Nugget.

''10.)'' [[Fantasy Stick]]
** Either use a Life Tree Staff in [[Mystery Stick]], or Ziegel Nugget -> Iron Clay -> Moon Tablet.

''11.)'' [[Single Mixer]]
** Directly use a Humming Quasar or Ziegel Nugget.


===Ultimate Armor===

As with the ultimate weapons, you can have a super optimized set or a more generalized set. Both are fine.

This is, again, modified from jinhaoyu122's topic. Actually, it's grossly
simplified beyond the point of recognition.

* ''End Result''
** [[Robust Body]], [[Evolve Body]], [[Loving Soul]]
* ''Alternative End Result''
** Robust Body, Evolve Body, [[4-God Barrier]]

''1.)'' [[Precious Stone]]
** Use whatever liquid you like as a PP Booster.
** For the first setup, use Green Crystals with Evolve Body and Loving Soul.
** For the second, use a [[Dragon Crystal]] (4-God Barrier) and a Green Crystal (Evolve Body).

''2.)'' [[Moon Tablet]]
** First, create a [[SP Neutralizer]] with the properties your Precious Stone has.
** Now toss it in, along with a Natural Extract (Robust Body) and a PP Boosting Iron Clay.
** Keep Robust Body and your other two properties.

''3.)'' [[Celestial Shirt]]
** You need 5 of these.
** You can directly toss in the Moon Tablet you just made. Magic Fiber should suffice for your PP Boosting needs.
** To get all effects, it's easy to use Comet Crest Stone or another Celestial Shirt.

** ''Logy Special'': Make a Chain Shirt using an Enhance Body Ziegel Nugget, then make a Celestial Shirt with all three Body properties. (Yes, one person can't have Loving Soul. Logy happens to be at the beginning of the chain, so it's him.)

''4.)'' [[Dragoon Cape]]
** However many you think you want. Less speed, more attack/defense.
** I managed using Dragon Scale, Slag Cable, Moon Tablet, as well as a PP Boosting Dragoon Cape.

===Ultimate Accessories===

The two setups are very different this time. And I still managed to give them roughly the same steps!

* ''End Result''
** [[Magic Stone]], [[Soul Binder]] x5, [[Brother Call]] x4, [[Royal Crest]], [[Exceed Belt]]
** Every last one of these has [[Wind Soul]], [[Night Lord Soul]], [[Absolute Senses]]...
** ...except Exceed Belt, which has [[Demon Soul]] over Wind Soul. You can try to replace it with Fire Soul. Or you can be lazy and just use Wind Soul...
* ''Alternative End Result''
** [[Royal Crest]] ([[Moonlight Soul]], [[Sunlight Soul]], [[Light God Soul]])
** [[Brother Call]] (Moonlight Soul, Sunlight Soul, whatever you like!)
** (Optional) [[Soul Binder]] (Moonlight Soul, Sunlight Soul and Light God Soul)

''1.)'' [[Moon Tablet]]
** If you want Absolute Senses, create an Iron Clay using Sky King Fossil.
** Create [[Mixed Lubricant]].
*** If all your properties are from Natural Extracts, make a Lubricant with any property.
*** Otherwise, toss Absolute Senses and one property from a Natural Extract onto your item. You will need some PP Boosting.
** Now for the [[Distilled Water]].
*** Toss in your Mixed Lubricant and your second Natural Extract.
** Toss your Distilled Water and a PP Boosting item into a [[Neutralizer-B]].
** Then directly transfer all that good stuff to your Moon Tablet. If you have a remaining Natural Extract, toss it in.
** You will need a bunch of these. (5?)

''2.)'' [[Soul Binder]]
** Create a [[Comet Crest Stone]] using your Moon Tablet. Then toss it in the Soul Binder.
** Be sure to use Quantity LV1 and LV2, as well as Reset Attribute on Water.

''3.)'' [[Royal Crest]]
** Using that same Comet Crest Stone you just made, as well as a PP Boosting Iron Clay, you've got an easy synth.
** Maybe go for high Water and low Fire; that's a high crit rate and some reduction in damage. The other Fire is a decent option, though.

''4.)'' [[Brother Call]]
** Must max all elements and toss in your Moon Tablet. A PP Boosting Automatic Drive should be useful.

''5.)'' [[Magic Stone]]
** Yup. Toss in a Moon Tablet and max your elements.
** [[Spirit Magnet]] should prove useful, as well as Reset Attribute on Earth. An Automatic Drive works as well.

''6.)'' [[Exceed Belt]]
** All elements should be maxed. Toss in your Moon Tablet directly.
** Lazy way: Don't even bother with Demon Soul.
** Easy Way: Make a Moon Tablet using a Natural Extract that actually has Demon Soul on it, basically as instructed earlier.
** Harder way: Make a Magic Fiber using a Green Crystal that has Demon Soul and a PP Boosting Medical Solution.
*** Toss in everything but a Medical Solution, use Power+ LV1 on it and toss it in.
*** Use Crafting Help LV3 on the Medical Solution, then Reset Attribute on Fire.
*** Now Division on Medical Solution. You can Compress and whatnot from here.

The first set of equipment gets divided as follows:
* Magic Stone to Escha
* Royal Crest and Exceed Belt to Lucille
* Soul Binder to everyone except Lucille
* Brother Call to everyone except Lucille/Escha.

Basically, Lucille gets pumped up (she needs the help) and everyone else focuses on supporting Escha. I
will say, if you use something like an awesome Tauzent Blitz to start off the chain, you will wind up
triggering Catatrophe too early. Dimension Bomb is better for this purpose. But 200,000+ damage to the
final boss! LOL.

Incidentally, you can switch Escha and Logy's accessory/armor sets if you happen to have Tauzent Blitz instead of
Knowledge Book.

Here's the generic process, from afreaknamedpete:

# Buff Escha (or whichever alchemist is last) using Eye Opener
# Break Impact with Awin
# Poly. Poison debuff
# Double Draw Logy -> Lucille -> Awin -> Linca -> Threia -> Escha

I also beat that Thirsty Water God (Plus exclusive, a level 100 monster with 200,000 HP) with the set I
describe on Logy's side. But it was close because he steals your items.

===Uber Items===

Note that some of these are for fun, some are not. Like, Eye Opener is essential, but Goddess Shield isn't.

====Support Item Preparation====
=-----=
The properties here will not net you the most powerful item. But they will get you a great infinite use item.

''1.)'' [[Spray]]
** Use [[Paper Scraps]].
** The level 4 property of Spray is Recycle; this combines with Recycle+ to give you [[Low Energy Mode]].
+
''2.)'' Another Spray
** Use the Spray you just made, [[Junk]], and Paper Scraps.
** Keep [[Perpetual Motion]] and [[50% Automatic]].
+
''3.)'' [[Distilled Water]]
** Use the Spray from #2. Keep Perpetual Motion and 50% Automatic.
+
''4.)'' [[Slag Essence]] with the [[Slag Wave]] property.
+
''5.)'' [[Cup of Life]]
** Use the Slag Essence; keep Slag Wave. (''Note:'' If you want to use this property elsewhere, you can duplicate your Cup, then synth Slag Wave into a Medical Solution. I will assume you do this for the Command Chime, which is by no means a necessary item. Feel Free to keep Traditional Soul and PP Maximization.)
+
''6.)'' [[Medical Solution]]
** Use Cup of Life and Distilled Water.
** Keep Perpetual Motion, 50% Automatic, Slag Wave.
=-=

+
+
+

==== Canned Food====
=-----=
More prepwork.

You need a Green Crystal with [[Super Properties]], another with [[Jumbo Blessing]] and a Ziegel Nugget with [[Cost Bonus]].

''1.)'' [[Apple Jam]]
** Use [[Medical Solution]] (Traditional Soul, PP Maximization, PP Expansion)
+
''2.)'' [[SP Neutralizer]]
** Make it with a [[Green Crystal]] that has [[Super Properties]]. Repeat process for a separate SP Neutralizer with [[Jumbo Blessing]].
+
''3.)'' [[Ziegel Nugget]]
** Use SP Neutralizer (Super Properties) and Ziegel Nugget (Cost Bonus).
** You may need some PP boosting from Iron Clay or Cardboard <_<
+
''4.)'' Another Ziegel Nugget
** Use SP Neutralizer (Jumbo Blessing)
+
''5.)'' [[Iron Plate]]
** Use Ziegel Nugget (Super Properties, Cost Bonus), Ziegel Nugget (Jumbo Blessing), and Cardboard (Trad. Soul, PP Max., PP Exp.).
** Keep Super Properties, Cost Bonus, Jumbo Blessing.
+
''6.)'' [[Canned Food]]
** Use Apple Jam and Iron Plate. (Fruit Pie has a decent Earth bonus, for Quantity.)
** Keep Super Properties, Cost Bonus, Jumbo Blessing.
=-=
+
+
+

==== Elixir Base====
=-----=
''End Result:'' [[Slag Wave]], [[50% Automatic]], and [[Perpetual Motion]]. Basically an infinite use, automatic Elixir that also increases your support gauge.

** Use PP Boosting Dragoon Cape and Slag Wave Medical Solution
** Keep Slag Wave, 50% Automatic, and Perpetual Motion.
** You will want to Reset Attribute on Wind at the end to get [[HP/MP Recovery S]]; the alternative is [[HP Recovery S3]], which is also very good, but no MP. Your choice. You will want status effect immunity with this setup.
=-=
+
+
+

==== Knowledge Book====
=-----=
''End Result:'' [[Super Properties]], [[Cost Bonus]], [[Jumbo Blessing]].

** Use your special [[ Canned Food]], [[Treasure Grimoire]] (with PP Boosting properties)
** Use Reset Attribute on Earth at the end.
** Be sure to boost Quantity both times.
** ''Do NOT use Compression.'' It weakens your Jumbo Blessing because it reduces the size by one.
=-=
+
+
+

==== Tauzent Blitz====
=-----=
''End Result:'' [[Super Properties]], [[Cost Bonus]] or [[Light Core]], [[Jumbo Blessing]].

''1.)'' [[Sun Flower]]
** Use the [[ Canned Food]] listed above, as well as the PP Boosting Dragoon Cape.
** Keep Super Properties, Cost Bonus, Jumbo Blessing.
+
''2.)'' Use PP Boosting Dragoon Cape, Sun Flower
** Use Reset Attribute on Wind. Water's lowest effect is cute, but not necessary.
** ''Do NOT use Compression.'' It weakens your Jumbo Blessing because it reduces the size by one.
** You can keep Light Core over Cost Bonus; I couldn't tell you which is better for this item. They have similar damage output according to Uryvichk.
=-=
+
+
+

====Dimensional Bomb ====
=-----=
''End Result:'' Super Properties, Cost Bonus, Jumbo Blessing.

Keep in mind this is nowhere near as good as a Knowledge Book or Tauzent Blitz. But if you don't have the best item for Escha or Logy, this acts as a decent stand-in. You can skip this if you like.

''1.)'' [[Medical Solution]]
** Use [[ Canned Food]] (Super Properties, Cost Bonus, Jumbo Blessing) and PP boosting Distilled Water.
+
''2.)'' [[Dimension Bomb]]
** Use Medical Solution, Cardboard with PP boosting properties.
** Keep Super Properties, Cost Bonus, Jumbo Blessing.
** ''Do NOT use Compression.''
** Put Buried Bomb in.
** Use Power LV1 on Jet Black Cube.
** Put Jet Black Cube in, then use Perfect Division on it.
** Put Cardboard in. Use Quantity LV1, then Conversion LV1 to Earth.
** Put Medical Solution in. Conversion LV3 to Earth. Quantity LV2.
** Reset Attribute on Fire. CP Recovery+ LV3.
** Division on Medical Solution.
** Absorb Attribute LV2.
** You now have [[4D Damage]]. Yes, this is a very good Effect; that's why it's hard to get.
=-=
+
+
+

====Poly. Poison ====
=-----=
''End Result:'' [[One Time End]], [[Perpetual Motion]], and [[Mach Throw]].

# This assumes you have a Natural Extract with Mach Throw.
# You should have a Ziegel Nugget with One Time End.
# Tauzent Blitz is probably a better debuffer, but this does well enough.
+
''1.)'' [[Spray]]
** Make with Ziegel Nugget (One Time End) and [[Spray]] (Perpetual Motion). You will need PP Boosts.
+
''2.)'' [[Distilled Water]]
** Make with Spray, keep those properties. You should have enough PP boosting ingredients around to do this.
+
''3.)'' [[Medical Solution]]
** Use the Distilled Water you just made and a PP Boosting Colseit Fiber.
** Keep One Time End, Perpetual Motion, Traditional Soul (trust me on this)
+
''4.)'' [[Poly. Poison]]
** Make with Natural Extract with trait of your choosing (if relevant), Cardboard (PP Boosting properties) and Medical Solution.
** Keep One Time End, Perpetual Motion, and whatever you want.
** You will want to use Power+ LV1 on Medical Solution. From there, you should have no trouble maxing out all the elements.
** Use both Quantity LV1 and LV2. And Compression, since you can have it all. (At least, if you use Natural Extract, you can.)

This goes well with Dream Book.
=-=
+
+
+

====Time Watch ====
=-----=
''End Result:'' [[Earth Armor]], [[Perpetual Motion]], and [[Mach Throw]].

This assumes you made the Poly. Poison.

''1.)'' [[Black Neutralizer]]
** Make with Trio Taun (Frame Compress), Medical Solution (Perpetual Motion, Traditional Soul).
** Get the Level 3 Property (Frame Compress+).
** Keep Perpetual Motion, Max Compress (you'll need it later), Traditional Soul.
+
''2.)'' [[Moon Tablet]]
** Use Black Neutralizer, Natural Extract (Mach Throw), PP Boosting Iron Clay.
** Keep Perpetual Motion, Mach Throw.
+
''3.)'' [[Time Watch]]
** Use Moon Tablet you just made, PP Boosting Comet Crest Stone. I used Junk as my fourth.
** Use Power+ LV1 on Comet Crest Stone. And put it in last. Then use Division to put it in again.
** Use Reset Attribute on Wind.
** Use Compression and Effect+ LV3.
** Keep Earth Armor, Perpetual Motion, Mach Throw.
=-=
+
+
+

====Goddess Shield ====
=-----=
''End Result:'' [[Perpetual Motion]], [[Mach Throw]], and [[Goddess Blessing]]. Do not use Golden Aegis. It does nothing on this item.

Guess what? You can use that Moon Tablet you made with the Time Watch.

** I used Iron Clay (PP Boosting stuff), Golden Apple, Moon Tablet, and Slag Cable.
** Toss in Iron Clay, Moon Tablet, Slag Cable.
** Use Power+ LV1 on Golden Apple. Use it, then use Division on it.
** Use Reset Attribute on Earth.
** Remember to use Compression and Effect+ LV3.
=-=
+
+
+

====Eye-Opener ====
=-----=
''End Result:'' [[See Clearly]], [[Max Compress]], [[Perpetual Motion]].

This assumes you made the Black Neutralizer with Perpetual Motion, Max Compress, and Traditional Soul.

** Use Black Neutralizer, probably whatever Medical Solution you want.
** Reset Attribute on Earth.
** Use Compression.
=-=
+
+
+

====Demon Crucible ====
=-----=
''End Result:'' [[Demon's Crucible]], [[Max Compress]], [[Mach Throw]]. Whatever modifications you make, you should follow the fifth step carefully.

If you are just interested in the best effect, rather than all the properties, skip to the fifth step and use Moon Milk instead of Fertilizer.

''1.)'' Duplicate your Eye-Opener. (15 days. But if you're doing this, you should have plenty of time!)
+
''2.)'' [[Cup of Life]]
** Use Eye-Opener, keep Max Compress.
** You are welcome to get creative here and come up with your own properties to use (Slag Wave, Spirit Medicine, etc.)
+
''3.)'' [[Dried Herbs]]
** Make it with Natural Extract (Mach Throw) and PP Boosting Spirit Garland.
** Keep Traditional Soul, PP Maximization, Mach Throw.
+
''4.)'' [[Fertilizer]]
** Make it with Dried Herbs. Keep all its properties.
+
''5.)'' [[Demon Crucible]]
** Use Dunkelheit, Cup of Life, and Fertilizer.
** The following is from MasterLL.
** Add Heart of Flame and Cup of Life.
** Use Power+ LV1 on Dunkelheit. Toss it in.
** Use Quantity LV2, Compression, CP Recovery+ LV3.
** Use Division on Dunkelheit, then Quantity LV1.
** Use Perfect Division on Dunkelheit.
** Reset Attribute on Water.
** Add Fertilizer.
** Use Absorb Attribute LV2, then LV1.
** YOU. ARE. DONE. Keep Mach Throw, Max Compress, Demon's Crucible.
=-=
+
+
+

====Command Chime ====
=-----=
''End Result:'' [[Mach Throw]], [[Command Chime]], [[Slag Wave]]. Feel free to get creative on the third one. I don't think you really need Perpetual Motion here.

** Use Medical Solution with Slag Wave. See [[ Elixir Base]] for more info on that, if you didn't do it. Also toss in Moon Tablet (Mach Throw). My final one was Corundum Stone.
** Do the yada yada, get your elements maxed out, Compress the crap out of your item, Quantity LV2 and whatever.
** Reset Attribute on Wind at the end. This is seriously the reason I made this section.
** Both of Command Chime's Wind Effects are called Reduce Wait. But they're different, and the lower one has a greater effect.
=-=
+
+
+

====Dragon's Secret ====
=-----=
''End Result:'' [[Mach Throw]], [[Perpetual Motion]], [[Dragon's Power]]

** Use Medical Solution (Perpetual Motion, Traditional Soul) and Natural Extract (Mach Throw). I also used a plain Distilled Water and Dragon Tail.
** Toss in everything but Medical Solution. Use Power+ LV1 on it. Feel free to use Compression.
** Use Conversion LV3 on Wind. Use Perfect Division on Medical Solution, then Strengthen Material and toss Medical Solution in again.
** Reset attribute on Wind.
