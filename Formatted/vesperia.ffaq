The reality of email is that I don't respond to it often. I advise against asking me questions, as my memory is garbage.

Feel free to leave a note if you want me to respond no matter how late I get to it. This does not guarantee response, but it makes it MUCH more likely.

This guide was originally - partially - written by
soulxedgexkoji, but he had to stop due to college.

We had planned to be coauthors, but he decided to just give it all to me,
meaning that you're mine, suckers!

Also I originally wrote this during high school. Does it show? (Yes, yes it does.)

==Battle System==

This is almost adorable. I made this when I cared to make gameplay sections.

Also, I feel obligated to say that chara = character. Leader = the guy who
walks around. WM = World Map. S = Ship

|* Button     |* Non-Battle Action |* Battle action        |* Menu Action    |

| Back        | Watch a Skit      |                      | Change mode    |

Beyond the controls, there are quite a few layers to the actual battle system.

I'll go through the basic to the not-so-basic.

|* Attacking / Defending |

 Depending on how you move the control
stick, your default attack will change, meaning that you can hit different
ranges - for instance, you can attack more downwards to hit small enemies. You
execute different artes (special attacks, techs, whatever you wanna call 'em)
by moving the control stick with the A button (keep in mind that for artes and
normal attacks, there is an option of *not* moving the control stick). Every
character differs in how they attack, some more obvious than others. Also, as
you attack a non-guarding enemy, your TP - what allows you to use artes - will
refill.

When you defend, there are actually a few quirks about it. You can jump (not
overly useful), backstep (if you use up skill points for it - more about that
later), or use a defense arte (takes up TP - and skill points). When you're
flung into the air, you can use it to land on two feet, rather than your back
(again, skill points).


|* Fatal Strike |

You can include these in a combo for a grade bonus, or do them separately. They
instantly kill non-boss enemies, regardless of HP. All you have to do is attack
in a certain way for one of three bars to go down (they have directional values
- attacking down will make the bar corresponding to the down arrow deplete)
Artes also have the same effect - each is assigned a direction to deplete one
of the bars. Once the bar is depleted, a glyph with a direction will appear.
Hit RT. A way to make the glyph appear (when you missed your chance) is to use
an arte with the corresponding direction against the enemy when a direction is
depleted.

When you use them, the EXP, LP, and item drop rates can increase depending on
the fatal strike type and enemy type.

Here's a list of what each type of fatal strike will increase on each type of
enemy:

|* Enemy Type     |* Blue FS   |* Red FS    |* Green FS  |
| Human           | EXP^       | LP^        | Drop Rate^ |
| Beast/Magic     | EXP        | LP*        | Drop Rate  |
| Bird/Insect     | LP*        | Drop Rate^ | EXP        |
| Plant/Aquatic   | Drop Rate^ | EXP        | LP*        |
| Inorganic/Scale | EXP*       | LP*        | Drop Rate* |

: * Indicates that it's more difficult to trigger.
: ^ Indicates that it's easier to trigger.

One more thing to note is a FS chain. Basically, if you get them in a combo, a
chain is the amount of times you activate the ability to use a FS - you can
activate it several times in one combo by using artes of the same direction, or
the infinite combo using one arte. These INCREASE the effect of the FS color.
In other words, you can get rare items very easily if you get about four of the
right color in one combo.

You'll love this when you try to synthesize stuff with rare materials later on
in the game.

|* Skills |

I keep on mentioning skills over and over. Basically, they affect a wide range
of things, and can be accessed from the main menu (out of battle). They take up
points to use, however. A very nice one to have early on (and till the end of
the game) is Item Thrower, which allows you to use items on everyone. Also, if
you have certain skills equipped, your selected artes will be an Altered Arte
(meaning, frankly, the arte changes). You learn those separately after 100
uses (50 for spells).

Anyways, they come from weapons. You learn the skills off the weapons with LP.
You can always use the skills on weapons without equipping them or using any
skill points (which go up one per level), but otherwise, you need them points.
In a second playthrough, you can buy the ability to have each skill only cost
one point in the grade shop.

If you don't use skills, expect the game to be a lot harder than it needs to
be. Serously.

|* Overlimit |

So now I'll backtrack to the subject of attacking. As you attack, a
bar fills up - the overlimit guage. There are four levels, but they're not all
initially accessible. You activate it by pressing the D-Pad. This isn't
attached to any one character, meaning that anyone in the party can use it - it
depends on how you set your strategies  whether the computer will use it or
not. It also means that everyone contributes to it. Each level comes with
different effects:

| Level 1 | Burst Artes, attack infinitely and without restriction, instant casting |
| Level 2 | If two people are in overlimit, they can have each other's skill symbol (such as Fleck and Strihm), additional damage on fallen enemies. |
| Level 3 | Mystic Artes, no TP drainage |
| Level 4 | Invincible. |

Regardless of level, you can use your artes (including spells!) till you run
out of TP without fear of losing your combo, lags, or anything really. You can
even normally attack forever if you're low on TP.

Also, if you have a bunch of one type of skill, you'll get a little boost
depending on what type of skill they are. For instance, if you give Yuri a lot
of attack skills, he will get Fleck, which increases his attack during OL.

| Fleck   | Increase Attack during OL. (Attack skills) |
| Rockra  | Increase P. Def during OL. (Guard Skills) |
| Strihm  | Increase Mobility during OL. (Move Skills) |
| Laytos  | Recover HP during OL. (Support Skills) |
| Chrocs  | Extends Over Limit. |
| Kaon    | Recover TP during OL. |
| Twory   | Increrases EXP if battle is won during OL. |
| Nhosing | Nothing ;P (Various skills) |
| Goldos  | Increases Gald if battle is won during OL. (Guard and Attack Skills) |
| Ailus   | Increase M. Def during OL. |

(There's more, but I haven't toyed enough with the system to list them all.)

|* Burst and Mystic Artes |

While in overlimit, use a skill change or an arcane arte and hold the arte
button. It costs no TP, and it's basically just a stronger attack. Sorta like a
cross between a Mystic Arte and an FOF change (Abyss). Anyhow, they change when
you have certain skills equipped, much like a skill change. Hold A to use them.

Mystic Artes, the big kahuna of artes. Also known as Hi-Ougis. These are your
uber attacks, only used at overlimit level 3 and above. Hold B to unleash the
beast! However, the last hit of your arcane arte MUST hit in order to trigger
an MA.

|* Combo |

What's a game without having the ability to chain your attacks together?
Firstly, spell casters aren't really that great here, though it's possible for
them to create killer chains. They act as a supplement to your main attack -
adding more hits to a combo. Your melee characters, on the other hand, are very
able to string together a combination of normal attacks, base artes, arcane
artes, and more. Skills add to this madness, giving you things such as more
normal attacks. In other words, you aren't just bound to one type of attack at
a time. You can only do so much at once, however, and afterwards you'll have a
lag. Keep in mind that it doesn't quite work so well on enemies in overlimit -
you need to be able to stagger the enemy to make a combo.

And when you're in overlimit yourself, you can keep comboing till the OL bar
runs empty. Or even infinitely with a bit of exploitation...

|* Infinite Combo: Breaking the System |

METHOD ONE:

This only works if you have two controllers.

Basically, you need one player to be in overlimit. Trap an enemy against the
edge of the battlefield with your infinite attacking capabilities. Have the
second player taunt nonstop. Yes, nonstop. Your overlimit gauge will fill more
than it's being depleted. When you are about to get out of overlimit, trigger
it again and continue attacking. Nothing can stand against you. If you have a
weak weapon, this is how you can get the highest possible combo.

METHOD TWO:

One controller, one Rita, one overlimit gauge. If you have a full battlefield,
just have her spam wide area attacks (like Tidal Wave), and the gauge will
fill itself forever. Or until they die.

|    Skills | Minimum Damage, Spell End, OL Boost. Maybe Light Magic. |
| Equipment | Wonder Symbol |
|     Artes | Meteor Storm or Tidal Wave. |
| Overlimit | Level 3 |
|     Items | [[Usable|Pineapple Gel]]/[[Usable|Orange Gel]] (if you screw up), [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] (also if you screw up) |
+
|* Free Run |

It allows you to run all over the battlefield to raise hell, rather
than bind you to one line. It's your ticket to dodging big attacks and getting
away from the enemy, though it's nowhere near as handy as it was in Abyss.
However, don't attack while free running. You only get one stab, and the lag
time is the worst in the game.

There is one exception to the no attacking rule: when the enemy is down. But
my own timing is generally off, so I find it worthless.

|* Semi-Auto or Manual |

In the menu, if you hit the back button, you can change modes. There are three
to choose from, but I'll focus on the two I just mentioned - Auto is just
letting the AI do all the work for you.

The main difference between the two modes is that Semi-Auto takes you directly
to the enemy when you press an attacking button. It's also considerably harder
and more useless to jump.

Manual lets you control yourself completely. If you hit the attack button, it
doesn't matter if there's an enemy nearby or not - you attack. It's also
slightly less useless to jump. You get a small grade bonus for using it.

|* Menu |

Bringing up the menu supplies you with all sorts of options. You'll probably
find yourself using items a lot, but there is a small catch to using them - you
have to wait a little while before being able to use another, and you can't use
items on allies without a skill. You can also change strategies, equipment, run
away, manage artes (including forcing others to use the artes), and change the
camera. If you craft the Moon Selector, you can even change characters.

|* Strategy |

In the menu, you'll notice that you can change your AI settings. Highly
recommended, because they're stupid without your guidance. Hitting Y sets the
formation - which you can choose to have your allies stay in formation or to
move around as they please. The X button lets you edit the settings. You'll
notice all sorts of options - for instance, if you don't like Repede attacking
the same enemy as you, then simply change his Target setting to "Different
Enemy". You can edit all of the premade ones in this way, or you can even
create your own. Each character also has their own, unique strategy, so read
the description before using!

==Walkthrough Part 1==

This is sorta long-winded, but also somewhat important. At least read sidequest
stuff >_>


|* Sidequests |

I put sidequests in a certain order. Sometimes it's important, sometimes it
doesn't matter. I suggest doing the sidequests in my order without much
deviation. Otherwise you'll be wondering why a few sidequests didn't trigger
and then you'll be backtracking all over the world, which gets annoying.

Also, NEVER EVER EVER SKIP SIDEQUESTS. THERE ARE TIME LIMITS. Follow my guide
to the letter and I guarantee success. Even if you don't see a reward, you will
probably miss something if you skip even one sidequest.

Be careful. You'll yank your own hair out otherwise. Take it from me. I missed
one sidequest and started my third playthrough because of it.

|* Bosses |

My boss segments have recommended levels. Those are really *my* levels, give or
take a few. Meaning my level is generally somewhere in the middle. I get to
these levels by fighting every enemy in my way except on the world map and in
certain dungeons with an abundance of enemies (Kogorh comes to mind). Are
these recommendations necessary? Honestly, no. So long as YOU have no trouble
beating bosses, your level doesn't matter. My levels are a guideline, nothing
more.

Also, you'll notice that my boss strategies get more and more general. I
honestly cannot make you a better player, nor can I tell you how to play. And
then there's the fact that I'm a Yuri user for the most part, while you may
like Judith's (who I suck terribly with) aerial combos more. Basically, I tell
you what to watch out for and how to get the secret mission by the end. Tales
games have too many playstyles for me to tell you much more.

To make the game easier for bosses, get as many weapons as you can and aquire
the skills on them. It opens up a lot of the fun features in the gameplay to
boot. And that's really all I can tell you in that regard.


|* Items |

Most sections have an item checklist. However, these items aren't necessarily
in order (I discover new things on each playthrough, I swear!) . I used to combine
items like a dummy. I tried to uncombine them.

Speaking of items, as far as I'm aware, there is only one missable
non-sidequest item, which you can buy in Heliord. But if you come across
another, by all means, email me. I don't want to screw people out of 100%
completion >_>

|* Speedrun |

Finally, I have low level speedrun times, in which I bought 1/2 exp from the
grade shop. In this playthrough, I got the Low Level Challenger and Speedster
achievements, which I detail in the achievements section. If you're following
these times, don't panic if you're behind. I beat the game about 3.5 hours
before the time limit, so you have a bit of wiggle room. Besides, it's very
possible to *beat* my time; I hear of some beating it within 10 hours.

=--Note...--=
You'll notice me telling you to save. I mean it. You get an achievement for saving at all
of the points, and a couple disappear.
=-=

You start the game outside Yuri's room. After the cutscene, you appear outside.
If you wait just a couple seconds after you get control, you can see your first
skit. Go up the stairs to the left and search Yuri's room (the other door is
locked) for an [[Usable|Apple Gel]]. Oustide, then up the other stairs for another scene
about the blastia. After the scene ends, run up the ramp and go left to the
stairs to be introduced to the synopsis function (Wonder Log).

There should be a shop right next to you. It is wise to buy some [[Usable|Magic Lens]],
which you'll notice you already have a few of. Then run up the stairs.

Watch the scene, get a skit, and then take the first left you come to. Approach
the house, watch yet another scene, and examine the plant to the right for a
[[Usable|Magic Lens]]. Then check the second window on the left side of the house. Check
the candles for gald and [[Usable|Magic Lens]]. Go up the stairs and check the door on the
left. After you watch the scene, go out the front door and prepare for the
battle tutorial. Don't forget to use [[Usable|Magic Lenses]] on them if you are trying to
get 100% completion!

: <Drache> I'll be chipping in a lot, so watch out :D Also, I think it's totally awesome how Yuri draws his sword/ax.

| [[Usable|Apple Gel]]     |

Now, point and laugh at Cumore. What the...? Anyway, after you regain control,
get the [[Usable|Apple Gel]] in the back of the cell, save and go to the left. Check the
chest in the background to get your equipment and then leave. Also, there is a
[[Usable|Magic Lens]] behind the guard in the cellar. Don't forget it. You get sucked into
a battle when you go in the next room. Don't forget to [[Usable|Magic Lens]] them. From
here on, I don't think I'm going to remind you guys anymore because for one, it
would probably be annoying on both ends and two, it should be automatic if
you're going for 100%.

After the battle, run up the stairs and check the boxes on the right for an
[[Usable|Orange Gel]]. Also, if you go to the left side on the bottom floor you can find a
[[Usable|Holy Bottle]] in the boxes. Go down the middle passage, check the chests for a
[[Usable|Life Bottle]] and a [[Cape]], then head out.

Go up the stairs to the left and head out the passage. Watch the scene, battle,
then go through the top exit. Keep going north, watch the scene, run into the
room on the right and head to the right where you can eat some curry to restore
your HP/TP. Don't forget to check the fireplace on the way out for an [[Food|Egg]]. Go
to the north exit and grab the [[Usable|Life Bottle]] from behind the guard. Once you are
through, get the [[Usable|Apple Gel]] from the chest and save. Take the first left exit
and get the chest that has ''200 Gald''. Keep heading south until a scene kicks in,
go through the door, and prepare for your first boss fight.

 Recommended Level: 5-7

:NOTE: Lens the man twice. There are two parts to this battle.

 Strategy: The main thing you have to remember is to block often before
 you make your move. Zagi has a 2 to 5 second delay between his attacks.
 (this is only an estimate). Don't try to make unnecessary movements
 during this battle, it will only cause you to have to use items or heal
 more. What you should do is make ONLY forward jab combo's followed by
 Azure Edge. After you complete your combo, prepare to block his attacks
 Following this pattern, his health goes down rather quickly.

 About halfway through this fight (so when his health is at 2350), you'll
 be able to use your mystery girl noble who has followed you thus far.
 She will be able to heal you if you have taken lots of damage. Use this
 to your advantage. Continue the forward jabs followed by the Azure Edge
 then a block until Zagi is defeated.

=--Note...--=
* To get a title for Yuri, you must do all secret missions in ONE playthrough. You've been warned. It sucks. I know.

* Oh, and some item drops are unique to bosses. Just a couple, but still still enough. And Secret Missions give you different items. So you completionists, prepare to pull your hair out.
=-=
Estellise Sidos Heaurassein (Estelle) joins your party!

After defeating Zagi, head back inside Flynn's room. If you check the closet
immediately above where you entered, there is a [[Usable|Pineapple Gel]] and an
[[Usable|Orange Gel]]. Check the trunk at the end of his bed too and you'll find an
[[Usable|Apple Gel]].
Go towards the door to the table with the bowl on top to find a [[Usable|Holy Bottle]].

Run south and then go left to see another scene. After the scene, go through
the right door to enter another one of those weird halls. Press the switch and
grab the chest if you didn't get it before. Go back out to the main hall, head
north, and take the left exit. If you don't feel like fighting, you can sneak
past that first guard and then keep running down the hall. Take the first right
to another gate hall and pick up a [[Usable|Life Bottle]] out of the chest. Defeat the
guard, open the gate, and then since there isn't anything there except another
guard, go back from where you came. Head south here through the door.

Pick up the [[Usable|Apple Gel]] and [[Usable|Orange Gel]] from the chests, then move the
statue.

Once you are down the ladder, watch the scene, then run around following the
path and killing the mice. Don't forget to pick up all the chests that are out
in the open for a [[Usable|Life Bottle]], [[Usable|Magic Lens]], an [[Usable|Apple Gel]], a [[Usable|Holy Bottle]], ''some
Gald'', an [[Usable|Orange Gel]]. Go up the ladder to exit the dungeon. Watch the scene then
head south. Keep going to the right and save, then go directly south again.

: <Drache> Those of you on your second playthrough, did you  notice that Dein Nomos is depicted in the statue? :D

Head to the right across the bridge, then down back into the lower sector.
After the scene, go to the right side of the lower sector. During the scene you
get [[Usable|Melange Gel]] x 4, [[Usable|Apple Gel]] x 4, [[Usable|Orange Gel]] x 4, [[Usable|Life Bottle]] x 4, [[Food|Bread]] x 4,
and [[Food|Egg]] x2. You also get the [[World Map]] and ''500 Gald''. YAY! Now we are off to
Deidon Hold.

Repede joins your party!

Hehe, Estelle's such a dork.

When you appear on the map, just run straight forward, following the dirt path
until you find Deidon Hold. There's a stump of items (search point) to the
northwest, and a caravan to the south (and north) that you can rest at.

=--Note...--=
This is my last warning. Skipping pointless looking sidequests will most
likely result in you not being able to complete the series of sidequests
it more than likely belongs to. Or even something from *another* chain of
sidequests. I. Speak. From. Experience.

Once you arrive here, you will get a tutorial on weapon skills. After that is
finished, run up to the north part where the guard is standing next to a door
and enter the Guard Tower. Run to the back and take the stairs up. Once here,
get an [[Usable|Apple Gel]], [[Food|Milk]], and an [[Food|Egg]], then take the ladder
up to another floor.

=--Note...--=
Never never never sell your weapons. Grab the skills on them and synth
away for new ones. I don't recommend using weapons if you have already
learned the skills on them, even if that weapon is the best you have.

You can go all the way back down.

Now, try to head out the north exit. Watch the scene, then head down to the
lower left section of town. Talk with the pink haired lady and her sidekick. Go
to the tent area to collect an [[Usable|Orange Gel]] and [[Usable|Magic Lens]].
After you finish with
them, head back to the weapon dealer from before and stock up. If you can
afford it, upgrade your weapons. When you're done with that, save, then head
south and exit to the world map.

When you arrive on the world map, head west and up onto the plateau with all
the trees. When you get to the dead end, enter the forest that is in between
the mountain gaps.

Run forward and follow the path around, fighting monsters as they appear. At
the first fork, if you run to the right you can pick up an [[Usable|Apple Gel]]. The north
fork leads to another fork. Stay north for an [[Iron Circlet]], then to the right
for the next scene. Watch what happens, get the cooking tutorial. To the south
of the area is [[Food|Egg]] and [[Food|Bread]]. Well-hidden, in fact.

=--Note...--=
Master all HP and TP recipes with one person (not Repede) and have three
stars with the rest of the recipes (Attack, Defense, etc.).

Yuri is the logical choice, as he's always around. However, in order to
to get all the recipes, you'll have to cook with other characters. For
instance, cooking Sandwich many times with Estelle eventually nets you
Rice Ball. See [[Cooking]] for the full list.
=-=
Open the chest behind you for a [[Usable|Magic Lens]] and then save. Follow the south path
to a chest for [[Hard Mail]] and keep going. Open the next chest to get a [[Cape]] and
keep following the path until you meet Karol. Watch the scene, open the chest
for a [[Usable|Life Bottle]], check the south end of the final stretch for a fork and an
[[Usable|Orange Gel]] (meaning, go backwards a bit), then exit.

Karol Capel joins the party!

: <Drache> Play Tales of Eternia for anything eggbear related. :)

====World Map====

When you exit the forest, just run up/right a little but until you see the
city with a huge tree sticking out of it. That is our destination, though
let's hold off on that for a bit. To the north
of Halure, however (up the cliff area), is a search point.

If you go to the cave area and to the left as you enter, you can find the

[[Cooking|Salisbury Steak]] is now yours to cook. You can get this later if you like.

To the east of Halure, you might have noticed a blocked road leading up a
cliff. It leads up to a search point. You can get there by going up the cliff
next to the cave place.

Most of the beginning of this place is just one big scene that you need to
watch. Once you regain control, go to the mayor's house - the first one you
see. Check the tree for a [[Usable|Magic Lens]], and the right part of the house for an
[[Usable|Orange Gel]]. Outside, head up the path, across the bridge, and into the nearest
house (er, inn) to get an [[Usable|Apple Gel]] from a room and a Lloyd (Symphonia)
reference on one of the papers on the wall. Continue on the path outside to
find Estelle. Get control and run up the path again to the tree (after a scene
with Karol), then go through another scene. Now head back down the ramp you
went up and go across the bridge and to the back where the item shop is. Ask
for a [[Usable|Panacea Bottle]] but get rejected. Talk to Karol and then head out of town.
Time to go to Quoi Woods again.

Go back to the woods that you just came from a couple minutes ago.

Follow the path to the area where Estelle had her little accident. Acquire the
Nia Fruit and then watch the scene. Go to the left then south and get ready for
a boss!

* Recommended Level: 8-9

This boss is not very hard at all. Basically, just get rid of
his companions in the beginning and then have everyone focus on
attacking him while you have Estelle healing from the back.

Although this boss is not terribly hard, he does have a couple moves
that can catch you off guard. The main one you have to watch for is his
multi-swing attack because along with dragging you into his range, it
also racks up damage rather quickly.

He shouldn't be too hard, but like I said, he can deal some decent
damage near the end of the battle. Use items if you need to. A good
strategy against bosses is to surround them. Try to run around the boss
using free run to get to his backside, then pummel him.

After you finish him off and claim your Eggbear Claw, head out of the forest
from the way you came and go back to Halure.

It's scenes like those that really make me like Yuri. "Raaaagh!"

Also, on your way out, as you pass the area where the save point is, notice the
huge monster in the background. That area's blocked off for the time being ;)

====Halure====

When you get into Halure, go talk to the old man on the right in front of the
mayor's house. Get the [[Lurluria Petal]] and then go talk to the item shop owner.
Get the Synthesis "tutorial" and then go up to the tree. Watch the scene that
follows. I do recommend synthing obsessively.

Head up to the tree to get a [[Usable|Life Bottle]], the nearby chests contain a
[[Usable|Holy Bottle]] and a [[Usable|Nectar Bottle]]. Run down the ramp and then talk with the Mayor. Go
back to his house and talk to him again, then leave the town.

=--Note...--=
* Make the [[Karolian Hammer +1]] before making the [[Karolian Sword]], completionists. You should progress with your synthing like so: Hammer -> Hammer +1 -> Sword -> Sword +1
**The reason is simple. You only get one Hammer, but the Karolian Sword can be made with BOTH the Hammer and Hammer +1. That sword could very easily screw you.

* Your availible synthesis items will disappear based upon the ingredients you have. It's really dumb. Check out the equipment sections for the stuff you end up missing.
** So if something disappears, don't panic. Just get the items you need when you can. You cannot miss the opportunity to synth anything, except what I just mentioned.

* Since I'm at it, you can safely not buy any equipment from shops, aside from a particular weapon in Heliord, till endgame. And you'll need the money!

Your goal in Aspio is to find Mordio. Once you have entered, go to the right
and try to get through the gate guarded by the knights. They won't let you in
because you don't have a passport so if you take the left path, you will find
another entrance (with a white thing you can examine to find the Wonder Chef).
In this library, the guy off in the corner by himself runs the Inn and the
woman that is a couple steps to his left is the Item Shop.

When you are done restocking, Save, get the [[Usable|Apple Gel]] next to the Inn, and then
go up the rest of the stairs. When you get to the small platform in the town's
center, take a right down the path there and go into the hut. After the scene,
run around to the back of the room and check all the junk. Watch the scenes
and then run to the book pile by the door and examine it for another scene XD

: <Drache> This is where Drache begins to take over writing the FAQ completely, starting with this section and a few following this. And you've been seeing her influence everywhere before this anyways.

You enter to a scene. I remember watching this on IGN. Anyways, run down the
path and turn right. You should find a chest with [[Usable|Magic Lens]] inside. Continue
along that path, hugging the left side, till you find a hidden chest for an
[[Usable|Orange Gel]]. Continue along the same path to find a chest of 800 gald behind a
pillar. Go back to the central path and take the left turn for a [[Usable|Life Bottle]].

Continuing along the main road, you'll come to a short scene. Talk about
strong o_0 Ignore the hole for the time being and climb the stairs for a [[Half Guard]].
 Now enter your hole for a scene. Go south, cross a bridge, and open the
chest for an [[Amber Cloak]]. Now go down the left stairs, and be sure to grab the
[[Leather Boots]] on your way across. On the other side, you'll have a scene.
Follow the path south to find another blastia. The scene gives you the
recurring (throughout the Tales series) [[Sorcerer's Ring]].

You can also use the ring to stun enemies, meaning you don't have to fight the
Golems if you use it. Go to the little platform for a forced battle to
demonstrate how surprise encounters work. Anyways, head north to get that [[Apple Gel]].
Keep following the path for another screen. Get as far north as you can.
There's a blastia you can hit to the left. Go back and to the left to claim the
[[Ohka]] and hit the blastia. Go to the opened up path, claim your [[Chain]] from the
chest, head south, hit the blastia, fetch the last chest of the area for a
[[Long Sword]], and leave to the north.

Go all the way to the left to open a hidden chest for a [[Great Axe]]. To the right
is a healing saving point (blue is the color that indicates this). Follow the
path, and under the first pillar is a blastia. Hit it, and follow the path all
the way around to hit the other blastia. Kill all the golems (if one is trying
to hide by being a block, just mess around with the Sorcerer's Ring or stick by
it) to make a path to a chest appear. Claim your [[Stiletto]].

Finally, to the left of the big baddie, get the [[Usable|Orange Gel]] outta the chest and
hit the blastia, and hit the blastia on the right side. Save again if you want,
cuz you're fighting the big guy.

* Recommended Level: 9-11

The first thing you should notice is his P. Def compared to his M.Def
that means Rita's spells are your best friend here. Goliath can be a
bit of a powerhouse but shouldn't cause too much trouble.

First and foremost, use a [[Usable|Magic Lens]] to identify him. Now
you've got two choices. If youre confident enough, you can do the
usual surround the boss and pound him to death strategy. However if
you stick to this remember to keep well healed and have Rita in the
back using magic. While Estelle heals, and you and the other ally
pound him from both sides.

Your other option to defeating the Goliath is the defensive strategy
After having unleashed your combo on him to get his attention, free
run back and around the battle field to avoid him. This gives your
allies a chance to attack him without a crushing result and lets you
recover some TP. After he has turned back to your allies, repeat the
above steps until he charges his X Buster. You'll notice this when he
stops moving and almost appears to stand up straight when doing this.
This is a good chance for you to attack his Achilles' heel for the
Achievement. Repeat the first few steps until completion.

: <Drache> My first few Life Bottless have been claimed by this guy D: Dammit Rita.

Heal at the save point if you're battered like I was. Out the way you came.
You'll eventually come to a scene and a small fight. Pwnt. Keep going out.

====Aspio + Halure====

You get a [[Passport]] upon entry. Go to Rita's hut for a cutscene. You won't get
anything else here, so scram ;) She'll force her way into the group as you
leave.

%

Go to Halure. It's not hard to figure out the way by now. You get a scene,
similar to an event in Symphonia. XD When you regain control, march up the tree
to find Rita. Go back the way you came for a scene. You'll get a tutorial on
overlimit (finally).

: <Drache> I'd pay 10,000,000 Gald for Yuri.

=--Note...--=
Now that you have overlimit, you can use a cheap trick to get items
easily. Actually, there are two. First, you can steal anything by going
into overlimit and spamming Repede's Thievery (which you'll probably learn
sometime after the next boss). The second one doesn't come till later,
and I'll explain it then.
=-=

You can synthesize the [[Special Flag]] now, which allows you to stare at an ass
other than Yuri's while walking around. Drache thinks he's hot, so she'll
continue to stare. Or you can wait and get it from a boss. :P

Yes, sidequests aren't usually designed with convenience in mind.
So now you'll be let loose into the forest. Some things are slightly
hard to see, I guess, so bear with me here...

Soon you'll come at a fork in the road. Go straight. You'll run across a
billybally flower and a cutscene will ensue. Poor kid. If you continue
following the path, you come across a chest with a [[Francisca]]. There's another
fork to the south. Take it to get a [[Usable|Poison Bottle]]. Now, go back to the first
fork and take the east path. You'll find more billybally. From here, continue
to go east for a [[Usable|Melange Gel]].

Go back and take the northern path. You'll find...le gasp...another fork. Go
west for a [[Scarf]]. Going back to the east leads you straight to two Life
Bottles. Keep following it until you see a path branch off to the northwest
next to a save point. At the end is a [[Tama-hagane]].

Heal and all that jazz. Boss battle begins now.

: <Drache> Y'know, I found the demo version of Gattuso easier o_0 Took me forever to get that secret mission. Don't feel bad if he pwns you several times =P He *is* rather unbalanced, even for a boss.

* Recommended Level: 13-17

Remember, those flowers stun you!

Woo, boy. Lots of people who tried the demo couldn't take this guy on.
For starters, take out the little guys. They're nuisances and fairly
weak. It shouldn't be hard if all your melee people are hacking away at
them. I'd suggest turning off or not using any wind artes.

When you finally kill the two lackeys, abuse every fire arte you have.
Often. I don't suggest attacking from the front, if possible, because
that's where the attack seems to be the most...vicious. In particular,
if you see the big guy charging up for a poison attack, free run it
outta there. You don't exactly want status effects ;) On that note, all
his big attacks take a while to charge up, so *watch* him and Free Run
away as necessary. If possible, lure the big guy into the billybally
flowers to stun him (attack to make the flowers release the stuff -
then run out the pollen's range), staying just out of range so that you
don't get stunned yourself.

Keep in mind that it has lower M. DEF than P. DEF, so use Yuri and
Repede as distractions for Rita - you may even want to keep Fire Ball
on a shortcut.

Of course, the most mindless strategy would be to overlimit then
infinite combo his ass whenever you have the chance. It's pretty nice.

* Drops: Power Light, Attack Ring, Great Wolf Fang
* Experience: 700

So, with that outta the way, you'll be in a nice wide area with a couple of
billyballys. Go west for the trailer's cutscene. Hell yeah.

|* Sidequest |
* Elucifur's Grave
** Investigate the small grave there. It's a rock to the west.

Well, don't leave quite yet. There's a treasure chest full of [[Usable|Orange Gel]] for
you just to the south ;) Soldier onward and outward now. You'll come to a fork
(surprising, I know). Take the eastern route and then turn north (you'll know
the area by four enemies in the area) for an [[Armet Helm]], ''2000 Gald'', and a
[[Holy Bottle]]. There's nothing to the south, except a dog =P

Go back to the fork and south you go to get out. Congrats, you beat the demo?
Anyways, there's a blurb about camping as you leave. Go west now to leave.

|* Sidequest |

** Stop~ Go back and approach the blastia through the main road. Crazy woman. Apparently this isn't necessary for Judith's best weapon, but do it anyways, just in case. It's a terribly picky sidequest.

You enter to a scene - I remember watching this on IGN. You'll eventually
gain control - alone =) Go down and to the right until you see a moving object.
The Wonder Chef will teach you how to make [[Cooking|Sorbet]]. If you're a completionist
and out of [[Usable|Magic Lens]], now is the time to grab some. Go into the alley north
of where the party is and prepare for a fight. Afterwards, watch the sweet
cutscene. And the "lovely" poster appears again.

Well, go find Karol and Rita. They're next to the inn. Go ahead and enter when
you feel like it - it's not like there's much else in the town. Go into a back

get the Kotaro. Keep fighting the monsters until you get a [[Small Key]].

Back in the room you were just in, go to the north path now. Fight enemies for
a [[Small Wolf Key]] this time. Go back and to the left for a scene. Go on to the
next room for another scene. You'll be back outside. If you go to the tree back
by the front entrance, you can get a [[Usable|Poison Bottle]]. The chest by the save point
has a [[Usable|Mat]] in it. Go on for a scene...and a fight. What. A. Creep.

Strategy: Zagi has some hard hitting attacks, but as long as you manage
keep yourself healed up, it's really, really easy. He makes excessive use
of aerial attacks this round, which are hard to dodge when you're in
front of him, but it also makes him a sitting duck when he lands.

The real problem is getting the achievement with this guy. He's a real
pain in the ass to knock overboard. You have to get under him and
overlimit to do it, but the real problem is just getting under him when
not being attacked. Bait him yourself towards the edge and block his
attacks until he launches above you and trigger it. Alternatively, you
use Fang Strike to get him in the air, then overlimit.

After the scene, go straight until you find an odd, cylinder object. Examine it
for a scene, then go right for a [[Usable|Paralysis Bottle]]. Ignore the door for now. Go
left now for an [[Epee]] and a [[Straw Hat]]. Eventually you will come to a rectangle
door in the ground. Watch the scene and get down there for another one. Go to
the top left corner and use the Sorcerer's Ring. Go back up and enter the first
house you come across for a [[Usable|Mat]]. Now go to the house I told you to ignore for
[[Password Clue 1]] and an [[Usable|Orange Gel]].

Back to the warp thingy. Watch the scene, and hit it with the Sorcerer's Ring.
Move forward in it. Go left and enter the house on the end. Claim the [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]
 and check the side of the house for three [[Usable|Magic Lens]]. You can save
downstairs if you want, but skip the spiral staircase. Go upstairs for an
[[Usable|Apple Gel]], [[Cocktail Dress]], and a [[King Sized Belt]]. Go through the door and hit
the warp outside. Go left on it to be brought higher up.

Head in the building to your right for a [[Holy Raven]] and an [[Usable|Orange Gel]]. Up the
ladder and hit the warp thing. Go right, get your [[Tsurugi]], then go down until
you can check the edge and go to a lower level. Go back to the warp and go
forward this time. Enter the building, go up the stairs, and get [[Password Clue 3]]
and a [[Lamellar Leather]]. Go back to the edge of the cliff you were at and
check it to go down.

Now go all the way right for an [[Usable|Apple Gel]] and enter the door. Snoop around for
''1000 Gald'' and go downstairs. Check for [[Password Clue 2]], and a [[Purple Ribbon]].

Go outside, then all the way to the left for a scene about Fatal Strikes.
You'll be forced in a battle to do one. Keep going until you find a [[Seed]] - a
chest, I should say. It's an interesting enemy XD You'll get ''3000 Gald'' for the
trouble. Head up the stairs and enter the building for a [[Usable|Life Bottle]] and a
[[Usable|Paralysis Bottle]].

=--Note...--=
Do 100 Fatal Strikes with all your party members for titles. Including the people you don't
even have yet. Don't worry, you have the whole game to get around to it.

This is where the second method of getting items easily is. I first
told you how to steal effectively, so now I'm going to tell you how to
get any drop you want. Go into overlimit with Rita and spam an attack
with the FS direction (look in the artes menu!) that makes the enemy
likely to drop items.

It changes depending on the monster, and I have a table [[Item Drops|here]]
 detailing this. Afterwards, you'll notice the FS
symbol pop up. Keep hitting with that arte and it'll pop up over and
over again. These are known as FS Chains. Build up a few and you're
almost guaranteed any item you need.

Head back until you see a warp.

Go forward and enter the first building for a [[Usable|Mat]] and a [[Magic Mist]]. Outside,
you'll find a [[War Axe]] just next to the ruined stairs. Head down the cliff now -
remember this area? =P Well, I want you to go back to the save point now,
which means to go forward on the first warp and enter the house to the left.
Make sure you're healed up and stuff. Down the annoying stairs. Scene.

You need three Magic Lenses. Don't go in if you have less.

: <Drache> It certainly isn't like the PSX Tales of Destiny translation error horrors. I forgot what they hinted at, mainly because I used a guide... XD

The next scene is kinda awesome. The boss...not so much.

Wow, one on one. Too bad it won't last for long. Your party
gradually starts to come back. Anyways, this guy is HUGE. And he's near
impossible to stagger. His attacks blow you away. You really can't defend
against this guy. Your best bet is having Rita hack away at him from
afar, and maybe using Azure Edge. Your melee people are mere distractions,
really. On the plus side, he's slow as hell, and his attacks have a
gargantuan lag time. But~ his attacking range doesn't really allow for
hit and run tactics. Fatal Strikes do massive damage, so remember that!

Wait for him to stand on his hind legs and slash at him to for the secret
mission. However, he does it just before a strong attack. Ouch. Have fun
trying though. Oh, and it doesn't quite work in overlimit. I found that
out the hard way. Combo artes, such as Dragon Swarm, work best. You can
also get lucky with Rita and have her nail him with any spell.

* Drops: Shield Light, Defense Ring
* Experience: 1000

All that and you don't even get to see the monster dead. No Karol for you. So
go outside now to a scene. Leave (go down the cliff to get there) to find yet
another scene.

:<Drache> Cumore sounds familiar. Dist anyone? =P Liam Amazing O'Brien.

lol, expected "plot twist". You knew it, I knew it, we all knew it. Good that
it's finally out in the open, eh? Estelle gets the Royal Successor title and
she leaves the party. To Heliord.

===The Rising City, Heliord===

=--Note...--=
Dear collectors, there is a missable weapon for Rita in the item shop. I
have no idea when the inventory there changes, but it does. So be sure to
buy the [[Endless Heart]].
=-=

Lucky Yuri, he got pardoned. Guess Estelle thinks he's hot too. And Ioder...

Anyways, check the back of the room for the [[Cooking|Fish with Miso Sauce]] recipe. Leave
and keep going south for a scene. Go all the way to the left and talk to Flynn
for another one. Keep going towards the nearby building for *another* one.
Battle. Oh dear. But at least you get to see a bit about Burst Artes.

"I say raaaaaagh!" - Adecor (the "I say" guy, AKA Tweedle A)

: <Drache> Why is Tweedle B so much less memorable? Not that Tweedle A is exactly memorable by himself... Except for being so incompetent <3 Every game needs the typical lousy knight!

Honestly. That fight took a bit longer than I'd like to admit though, haha.
Alright, now go back to the building and stay there - Estelle is "resting" so
you can't see her. Afterwards, leave and go to the tall, spiral thingy. The
blastia. You get Estelle back. Go to the building you were first in and talk to
Flynn in the interrogation room. Cue dramatic music. Outside. Curious scene,
don't ya think?

Well, you'll find Karol in the hallway. Go back to the room for another scene.
Haha, it kinda sorta sounds like Rita has a girly crush on Estelle.
You get to sleep now, and continue the scene. Towards the
blastia for a scene. Honestly, they should just walk there for one huge scene.
What a way to weasel Estelle back in the party. XD

Return to Heliord and leave town to the left.

Follow the edge of the sea for a bit, then follow that path to the west. You'll
notice this huge thing covered in smog in the middle of a sandy area, but you
can't go there yet. Anyways, the town is obvious from there.

===The Den of Guilds, Dahngrest===

* Speedrun/Low Level Playthrough Time: 2:37

Enter to a scene. The building to your right is an item shop, the one across
the street is an inn and a store. Go north for a scene. Back to the area you
were in. Honestly, they should seriously just run there in the previous scene.
Take 'em out.

Check out the tavern to the left for what I think are random items (you have
to continue hitting A to get all your treasures). Exit and take the north
path. Check the right side of the room for the [[Cooking|Minestrone Soup]] recipe. Haha,
with that little diversion outta the way, go back to where the tavern was and
continue to the left until you get to a scene and fight.

Afterwards, take the northern path again. Scene. Leave town through the left
exit.

Just keep going through the forsested area until you see a dark green patch
of trees in the area.

A few paths aren't availble to you yet. You must upgrade the Ring. But don't
worry. I'll remind you ;)

Raven joined the party!

Huh, he was a whole level higher than my party. Anyways, walk along the path
and go up the tree for a scene. Step on the mushrooms/giant conks to the south
path for another one. Karol will learn the Bug Breath arte. Go north for a
[[Bastard Sword]] and a [[Chain Whip]]. Go back and take a left for another scene. A
chest with an [[Estoc]] is to the south of there. To the left is an [[Usable|Orange Gel]]. Go
to the north and take a left.

You will come to a fork (it's by a light). Go left until you get to a lower
area. You'll eventually get two [[Usable|Weak Bottles]]. Keep going till you find a dead
end. Now, head up the tree root - it's a bit hidden to the north - to get a
[[Rabbit's Foot]]. Back to the fork. Go south to another lower area, in the area is
two [[Usable|Poison Bottles]]. There's a save point in the next screen.

Just before the save point is a tree root to the right that you can go up.
You'll see a light to guide you. Follow it to a [[Usable|Lemon Gel]]. You can't do
anything further down, so return to the save point.

Up the path is a [[Seed]] chest. You get a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] for winning. Go up the
tree. Yet another fork plauges us. However, the lower path is blocked off.

Three [[Usable|Mind Bottles]] are a long the path. Now keep going until you see a blue
save point. Guess what's coming?

   <Drache> You have no idea how hard this area is to write for. Glad it's the

Bring Raven for the Secret Mission.

Setting that aside for now, this guy has a pretty big range. What you
to do is simply run in and stay on him. Let Rita do the talkin'. Face it,
she's awesome. If not her, then Estelle's Photon comes in handy. Any fire
artes you have are also lovely. Otherwise, just pound away. Really.
Having two healers is a plus.

As for the secret mission, you may want to control Raven yourself for this
one. You have to use Serpent as the enemy is trying to heal itself - when
it's down to half its HP. You *may* have to set the strategy to "Defend"
and make sure no one does anything other than heal you. If you're not
good with ranged combat, you can get close with Raven and simply use Just
Like Dancing on the boss (along with normal attacks, of course).

A helpful hint is this: The monster will be more focused on walking than
fighting when it's time to heal.

Alternatively, if you have the Moon Selector, just use it when the boss
goes to the middle of the battlefield to heal. Don't be shy about getting
right under him.

* Drops: [[Spicy Potion]], [[Stun Bracelet]], [[Great Crab Shell]]
* Steal: [[Usable|Savory]]
* Experience: 1100
* Gald: 1100
* Secret Mission: Hit him with Serpent as he tries to heal himself.
=-=

I love Raven for some reason. He's so melodramatic. XD Intorducing the Fell
Arms sidequest. But let's set that aside for now. Or for a second playthrough.
So, um, out of the forest. You'll eventually come to a scene. Now keep going
out.

: <Drache> Oh hey, I'm actually not writing the next couple sections. Though I have written over it as time passed. Quite a bit, in fact.

As for the destination...!

====Dahngrest====
%

When you get back to Dahngrest, head North to the Guild Union HQ. If you didn't
get it before, in the back right corner is a floating rubber ducky. Talk to it
and discover the Wonder Chef guy. He'll teach you [[Cooking|Minestrone Soup]]. After that,
head to the back middle into Don's Chamber.

Watch the scene, then run back outside to the town square and watch the next
scene. Go back to the Guild Union HQ, take the left door, and watch the scene.
After you gain control, go back upstairs and head back to the town square.
Scene and skit. Go rest, stock up if needed, and save. Once you are finished,
run outside and head to the northeast until you find Rita. You're going on a
bit of a trip.

And then another scene. JESUS CHRIST ON A CRUTCH! So many scenes...then a
semi-boss battle. I won't even make a box for it because its not important.
You fight Bandido x 8. Just wait until they all gather around you and do
Dragon Swarm or Crushing Eagle a couple times to wipe out over half of them.

By the way, be sure to lens those Bandidos. I'm pretty sure they're different
from the other monster also known as Bandido. So be careful.

Watch the scenes. I got a kick out of this one.

: <Drache> You'll find that Yuri and Judy work well together. Flirting~!

Judith joins your party! Crappy AI and all. Control her yourself, she's
terrible on her own! Like Estelle. Raven and Karol both surpass her as a healer
anyway. Raven's AI strikes me as pretty smart when it comes to Love Shot,
whereas Karol's TP drains a bit too quickly for my liking.

Where you were is a blue save point.

After you regain control, watch the skit and then run to the top right to pick
up a [[Usable|Life Bottle]] and a [[Usable|Melange Gel]] from the chests. Through the door there is a
[[Usable|Specific]] and three [[Usable|Magic Lens]]. Head over to the left and you get an upgrade,
[[Sorcerer's Ring Lv. 2]]. After you get the ring, go into the door and watch the
scene. Pick up the [[Usable|Pineapple Gel]] in the chest and the [[Usable|Life Bottle]] on the table
and leave. With this, head back to where you started and hit that switch to
lower a staircase. The soldier on the right sells some items, if you need any.

Once up the stairs, you learn about [[Limit Duo]]. After you get control, head to
the north part of the room to pick up a [[Battle Suit]]. Head through the door on
the left. Check the armor on the top of the screen to get a [[Leather Coat]].
Leave and head south to grab the chest with the [[Crescent Axe]] in it. Check the
barrels nearby for an [[Usable|Orange Gel]]. Go out any door to the south for a scene.

You can leave if you want by going down the ladder. Climb up the ladder and you
can find a [[Rivet Belt]] for our lovely mage. On the left is three [[Usable|Holy Bottles]].
Head down the middle passage to the big gear thing in the back.

When you get inside watch the scene and then shoot the gear with your ring.
Head upstairs and grab the chest containing a [[Kurama]] for the puppy. Shoot the
nearby gear with your ring to make the green aer go up higher. Go up the
stairs and shoot the golden gear on the right with your ring. On the next
level, the gear is to the left. You'll find an [[Usable|Orange Gel]] at the top of the
area.

Once in the next area go up the stairs and to the right where the golem is.
Grab the [[Blue Dragon]] out of the chest and then fight or stun the golem and
shoot the golden cog behind him. Up the stairs, then grab the [[Wizard Horn]] out
of the chest. Go to the back right, shoot the cog, then run all the way BACK
down to the first area with the pinwheel. Talk to the pinwheel for the [[Cooking|Salad]]
recipe and then shoot the gear so you can make the aer go higher.

Run up to the second floor and shoot the first golden gear to extend a walkway,
then shoot the second one to raise the aer. Go all the way to the top one now
and activate the two gears on the left and go upstairs.

Grab the [[Holy Cloak]] and head up two flights of stairs. You'll see a small gear.
Hit it, and go down a flight, taking the right path to the next gear. Now head
to the bottom and shoot the gear. This extends a walkway on the left side of
the next floor. Hit the next gear there, and head upstairs. There, hit the gear
to the left and continue up.

Grab the [[Spike Hammer]] and hit the gear to the left both of the gears on the
right. Finally, hit the last one on the right part of the floor below and go up
the stairs.

Pick up the [[Usable|Lemon Gel]] and [[Smash Bow]]. Save, then head up the stairs. Here, you
can get a [[Halberd]], [[Thief's Cape]], and a [[Warrior Symbol]]. Head to the left and
ride the elevator up. Watch the scene and prepare for a boss battle.

* Recommended Level: 24-26
* Before the battle starts, take off all of Estelle's artes except for First Aid and Nurse. She will need to focus on healing the whole time. Karol is also a good substitute, however.                                                      |

Magic Lens him as soon as the battle starts. After that,
TAKE OUT THE BRIDGE SUPPORTS. This battle will be ridiculous if you
don't take them out quickly. Be warned - if you have both Estelle and
Rita, this will be more difficult to do and you have to go as fast as
you can. Along with making the battle easier, it also nets you the
Secret Mission for this fight. Now focus on the regular enemies until
they are all gone.

The tricky thing about this boss is that most of his moves either hit
for a wide range area or the pull your characters into his range.
This makes dodging and blocking a little hard, but not impossible.

Stay away from him while he is in overlimit because his combos do a
big amount of damage and to more than one person. Use items as needed
and force Estelle to use Nurse as often as possible to make sure your
allies have enough health to withstand his attacks. If you can get
the timing right, unleashing a combo on him will stop his attack and
net you more time to heal, especially if you can keep the combo up.

Try to focus on getting your OL and unleashing it as soon as possible
and also go for Fatal Strikes if they become available. If you can
keep up the damage without getting wiped out, you should be fine.

you'll see a reference to Sakuraba, the composer. lol. Stay at the inn for a
scene :) Awesome.

Yuri earns the Vigilante title, and Repede the Sinful Sidekick title.

: <Drache> Repede's title is a mistranslation. It's really more like the "one who knows of the sin". I guess that was too long...?

The interaction between Estelle and Rita in the morning is so cute. Cute is
my Achilles' Heel >_> It surpasses everything and turns me to mush.

When you gain control, go south for another scene.

there'll be another cutscene. Talk to everyone, go to sleep, and continue on.

You heard the boy. To the inn! Scene. I love how no one uses blankets. Out with
you, and to the left exit. In the morning, head to the blastia. Talk to the
guard by the lift. Pick one to distract the guard. Pick Karol ;D You don't have
to, but I think it's funny. Go to the item shop now. If you don't have the
items, fight till you do. I had them =P Very very cute you are, Karol. Run up
to the guard now. Don't be shy ^_^ Go to the building on the right afterwards
as a knight. (Or watch Karol get his ass handed to him.)

: <Drache> Judith's outfit... no, just no. They could've made her way sexy if the Energizer Bunny idea was ditched. Estelle's question was hilarious though.

Hope you brought a healer (or two). These guys are weak, but
they're pretty deadly together. They can easily surround and kill you. So
focus on the small fry first, just one at a time. If you're using Yuri,
Crushing Eagle may be of some help. After enough of them are gone, you'll
at least want to keep Yeager away from healers and casters. His attacks
can easily pierce your defenses and stun you if you're not cafeful, so
watch out! Lucky for you, there's no secret mission.

Afterwards... poor Flynn XD

There's really only one way to go. Back to Capua Torim. Head east, btw. You'll

Head for the Inn. Scene. Raven gets the Old Spy title. You can wander around
now. Head towards the exit of town for Judith, btw. Raven is in the opposite
direction. Everyone else is easy to find. In the morning, run towards the boats
for a scene. Afterwards, keep walking to the docks for another scene with
Kaufman. Now head off to the dock where she is. Talk to her again to leave.

The man Kaufman introduced is named Tokunaga. Lol, I love Anise's doll. That
dude in Symphonia... not so much.

Head south and come to a scene with the fish. Now head west until you come to
a scene about the fog. Cue creepy music. Also, don't expect me to tell you
where any more of the search points are - they're everywhere, and you can get
to a lot of them now. Some appear as a pile of bones, others as a bump in the
sand. Later on you'll be able to access some from your boat!

When you split up, be sure to leave behind someone that you can control
reasonably well. You can buy crap from Kaufman if you're out.

So enter the next area and head up the stairs for an [[Ogre Sword]]. Go back down
and claim a [[Trident]], then head downstairs. Be wary of these rooms - the enemies
can only be seen through the mirrors (well, the ghosts). They also have shadows
but they're hard to see. Follow the path, grabbing a [[Usable|Lemon Gel]] along the way,
till you get to a different looking room. Take your [[Usable|Orange Gel]] and enter the
door on the far side of the room. Snoop around for three [[Usable|Magic Lens]] and a
[[Seal Bottle]]. Go back to the other room and march up those stairs.

In the east door, get a [[Takemikazuchi]]. Outside, claim the [[Snipe Xiphos]] and go
in the door on the far side. Fight the [[Fak]]e for a [[Usable|Specific]], and check around
for [[Food|Rice]], [[Food|Dried Seaweed]], and [[Food|Salmon]]. Must be rotten as hell, given that it's a
ghost ship. Yuri must have a gut of steel. Anyways, back in the other room and
up the stairs you go.

To the right! Grab the [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] and head through the door for a
[[Holy Bottle]]. In the door to the left, you'll come to a cutscene.

Time for the other party to take over. Climb up the mast, grab the chest with
a [[Usable|Seal Bottle]], [[Usable|Limit Bottle]], [[Usable|Specific]], and a [[Usable|Treat]] in it, and go down the
broken part of the mast. Keep going and enter the first door you see for a
[[Usable|Pineapple Gel]] and a [[Usable|Melange Gel]]. Exit and keep following the path to the next
door. Follow the hall for a [[Usable|Mat]], and keep going till you reunite with everyone.

Save, circle all the way around for an [[Usable|Orange Gel]], and enter the door to the
left for a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]. Head back and upstairs. Check around for ''4000 Gald'' and
a [[Usable|Seal Bottle]]. A cutscene will ensue when you go too far to the right. Snoop
for a [[Pirate Hat]] and the box (for a cutscene). Monsters attack, but they're
small fry. Head up the ladder for a [[Holy Symbol]]. Don't bother with the mast.
Head back down and take the door out. Go down by going to the dark part of the
floor. A ladder will be dropped. Go down like this till you're out.

Rita gets the Anti Nonsense title.

====World Map====
%
If you're up for sidequests, make sure to LOOK for Nordopolica so that you
don't get lost, but don't enter it quite yet. Get only close enough to see it
because the cutscene that comes when you get within certain distance will pull
you into Nordopolica proper for a long time.

Otherwise, Nordopolica time! Head in a slightly southewest direction. It'll
be at the very tip of a continent. It honestly shouldn't take more than five
seconds to see it.

I put these sidequests in an order so that you can do a sort of loop. You can always
find your ship at a port, so the loop ends at Capua Torim.

|* Capua Torim |
* Marking Map
** Walk forward for a scene. You get the Marking Map. Camp everywhere, and check the world map in the menu to see your progress. Repede gets the Fated One title. lawl. Alternatively, you can wait till the entire map is red so that you can easily see where you need to mark (it gets hard to see at the very end, sometimes even when the area *is* red).
** If you open the menu while traveling, you can see where you are in the upper right corner. This is important for some regions, especially mountains. Yes, you can piss in the mountains if you get close enough!

|* Zaphias |
* Dark Enforcer
** Head to the Upper Quarter for a scene. Then chase Shel down and talk to him again. Then speak with the lady with all the twerps around her near the shop. Yuri learns Tiger Blade and the Kingdom Celeb title.

Continue up to the Coliseum, and once inside, follow the path east till you
find the door. Walk up the stairs and talk to one of the guards (the non-
generic looking one). Bah, rejected. Raven leaves the party.

Head back down the stairs and talk to the Wonder Chef to the right of the exit
before you leave. [[Cooking|Kebab Sandwich]]? Sometimes I wonder about this dude. Stay
at the inn for a scene.

: <Drache> Trivia time! The evening star is called Vesper, so what's the dawn star called? Lucifer. Conspiracy much?! BTW, they're both Venus, actually.

Exit the Coliseum and head down the stairs till you reach a scene.

Now to the room where you met Natz to find Regaey. Scene.

When you feel good about it, enter the tournament (save first!). The first few
battles are hella easy, so don't worry. After battle three, you'll come across
a cutscene before the "boss". He's quite the heartthrob. Very recognizable ;)

Don't worry about winning this. Just survive. Cutscenes will interfere all the
time. Eventually you'll have an uninvited guest.

Make sure Yuri's in good health, but sit back and let Zagi
charge his blastia till it goes boom (make sure to hit him with magic
afterwards). You'll know it by the pink glow and him not attacking.

But really, after that, he's obnoxious, but still beatable, as always.
He's a friggin' cockroach, but not a difficult one. Spam your guard and
attack afterwards. Just don't let him pin you against the edge during
overlimit, because he can easily kill you there.

I suggest equipping the Dice, as it raises your grade. Mr. Ax Crazy turns
everything to chaos and runs. Run around and beat the crap outta monsters.
After a couple fights, you'll see a scene. Waltz down the stairs and keep going
till Judith talks to you. Head to the far south of town to find Repede. Keep
going to get outta town.

Not much to see here, folks. Follow the path. Beyond the forested area near the
path's end is a search point. Otherwise...

You're sprung into battle upon entry.

Run up to the first chest for three [[Usable|Seal Bottles]], then grab the second nearby
one for a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]. Continue down the lower path for a [[Mighty Guard]]. Now
take the upper path till you come to another fork. The lower path leads to a
Gigant, but I don't suggest fighting it quite yet. However, if you do fight it,
you get a [[Usable|Verbena]] and ''8000 Gald''. Come back later if you don't feel courageous.
So go up for yet another fork. Take the southern one for a [[Spike Bow]]. Now go
to the next screen to the north.

Take the right path down for a [[War Harpoon]] and [[Aquamarine]]. Now take the left
path up to the [[Avenger's Scroll]], then continue for a scene. By the save point,
head up north for [[Jiraiya]]. Go back down and head all the way east for a [[Spine Ripper]].
Now take the path north you haven't taken yet and go down when you get
the chance. Get the [[Silver Circlet]], return to the intersection, and take the
path north to the next screen. Once there, keep going till you reach the next
save point. In the next screen...

Lens everything.

This is a case were Karol is better than Estelle for healing.
Estelle has the spell advantage over Rita for once... but Tractor Beam
is awesome. I recommend Rita, and don't bring Raven/Estelle/Repede.

Pteropus itself isn't bad. But the bats he splits into? OH MY GOD. For
the secret mission, you have to take out the Leader Bat so that he can't
reform. Do it quickly. If you are a Judith god, great. If not, overlimit
and spam Tractor Beam, then use her Burst Arte (both are wider-range).
Then take out those highly annoying Magic Bats. Battle will be smoother
after they're gone.

If Pteropus reforms, he may split again. Oh, and don't ever kill the
Leader Bat last. Do the battle over again if that happens.

: In any case, spell Regeay backwards. Cute.

Before leaving, go south and get a [[Usable|Simple Tent]], and feel around for a
[[Silver Hat]] on the left. The next destination is obvious when you go outside.

Ew, I hate this place. Firstly, be sure to get at least one [[Frost Stone]] and
a [[Flare Stone]]. You can make the [[Limit Trio]] with these. You can get these at
night and in the day, respectively, and the time changes every so often as you
go along.

Also, you'll come across orange star-shaped enemies every once in a while. Kill
them off with a green FS for an increased chance of getting their item drop.
It comes in handy for synthesis later on.

As you go through this area, be sure to hit the cacti with your ring. It helps
to keep ya alive. In this first region, the exit is to the northeast. The first
area contains chests with a [[Stinger]], [[Usable|Limit Bottle]], [[Mizuchi]], [[Phoenix Guard]],
[[Flamberge]], [[Executioner]], and a [[Usable|Stone Bottle]]. Each chest is near one "wall" or
another. Stone Bottle is just to the north of Executioner.

As you go to the next region, you see a scene. Water~! Here, be sure to grab
the [[Rapid Shot]] to the south and the well-hidden [[Riot]] behind the save point.
Check the water for [[Air Stone]] x3. Continue to the next region.

Here, you can get a [[Silver Circlet]], [[Glowing Ribbon]], [[Striped Ribbon]], [[Flare Cape]],
[[Aqua Cape]], [[Usable|Lemon Gel]], and a [[Usable|Pineapple Gel]]. You'll also find a Giganto,
but you can come back for that later. Near the exit, you can find a couple
people collapsed. A save point will appear there, so be sure to save.

The next area brings a battle.

* Recommended Level: 29-32

Strategy: Ugh, a floater. Packs a bit of a punch too. Repede's a bad
option here, but Rita should damn well be a god. He's surprisingly easy
to simply beat up, but there's a slight problem with him - the secret
mission. One of the most annoying in the game. I suggest using Judith for
this, as her aerials kick ass. Basically, the boss will occasionally send
a core outside itself. You have to break it. Very difficult. He sends it
out when he changes the time. It's possible to do it with Yuri if you go
jump for it each time he brings the core out, but you'll be cutting it
fairly close.

The easiest method is to use Rita. Use Splash during the day, Fireball at
night to trigger the core being spat out, then overlimit, wait a second,
TRACTOR BEAM! Should be gone real easy with that.

You wake up in Yormgen. Next to your bed is the Wonder Chef, who teaches you to
make a [[Cooking|Croquette]]. Check the area that you can't see in the inn for an
[[Usable|Hourglass]] and an [[Usable|All-Divide]]. A wonderful Abyss reference is on the wall =)

: <Drache> May the folks at Namco Tales Studio never devise such a terrible sidequest ever again. I don't mind shipping NPCs, but that was nuts!

Exit the inn for a scene. Time to walk around! Next to the inn is a [[Limit Bottle]].
Head up north and hook to the right when you can, to get a [[Usable|Simple Tent]].
Talk to the random NPC nearby for a scene about the box.

Head all the way north to the Sage's place. Hello Duke. You're left to do as
you please. Go back in the Sage's to see Duke again. Check the west side for
a [[Strange Mark]]. Talk to everyone else now. Once done, rest at the inn and head
to the exit.

Head back to the desert, but this time, stick to the field. It makes things
easy. Remember that ugly thing you pass by. You'll be going there soon enough.
There is a search point in the area (the bones), but you have to go up a slope
to get to it. Now march back to Mantaic.

already. Otherwise, just get outta here and take the road to Noropolica.

===Nordopolica, Revisited===

Head up to the inn, save, restock, etc. Now stay at the inn. Head up to Natz

Strategy: Belius is pretty damn easy, actually. Even her secret mission.
She's just a tad hard to combo, but nothing you haven't seen before. When
she goes into overlimit, just stay back. She looks like she's throwing a
temper tantrum. Her combos are a tad brutal, so don't be shy about
guarding. She gets particularly nasty when she brings out the ice. When
you get her HP down about halfway, she splits into two. Instead of taking
both on, get the secret mission and put the lights back on. Just take
Yuri to all four lamps and light them with Destruction Field. Afterwards,
just pound her to submission.

Remember to lens the double!

Now get outta here. You'll eventually get to a scene. Keep going till you meet
Mr. Always There. Oh wait, that's Zagi, sorry. Anyways, Flynn lets you walk by.
Now you're as good as gone. Bye Judy. I'll miss you(r hotness).

You end up at sea. Be sure to save! Walk outside the cabin and talk to
everyone. Go back inside when you're done to move on.

But first, a side trip! Run to Zaphias, then to Yuri's room for a scene. Now,
as for your real destination...

Basically, head north from Nordopolica till you reach the beach then hoof it to
Dahngrest.

====Dahngrest====

Karol and Raven split. There isn't much to do now, so head to the inn, as told.
You can keep going around as Yuri if you want, but it's rather pointless. When
you wake up, head outside. After the scene, take the western exit.

Go west past Keiv Moc and head across the bridge. Head up the slope and your
destination is obvious.

control, go on inside to another scene and battle. Afterwards, head west and
check the miscellaneous junk for ''7000 Gald''. Check the armor to the north for
a [[Gothic Plate]]. Right next to the guard is a [[Usable|Lemon Gel]].

Head to the first door to the east. Check the weapons for a [[Grim Cardian]].
Exit and continue to the eastern hall. Take the first door for an [[Usable|Orange Gel]].
The second leads to an [[Usable|Apple Gel]]. Skip the third door and head to the end.
You get a [[Usable|Panacea Bottle]] and a [[Usable|Holy Bottle]]. Now head all the way back and up
the stairs.

Check the junk to the west for [[Gothic Guard]], and grab the [[Ruby Wand]] just past
the save point. Get the [[Usable|Magic Lens]] at the plant. Skip the first door and enter
the next one. Check the weapons for a [[Crimson Axe]]. Door number two leads to a
[[Usable|Limit Bottle]]. Three gives you a [[Stone Slasher]]. The one at the end gives you a
scene...

...No boss fight. How anticlimatic. Kill off what's there...

...And head back to Dahngrest.

Go back later for a [[Quick Trigger]], [[Usable|Life Bottle]], [[Usable|Syrup Bottle]], and
[[Usable|Nectar Bottle]].

Once here, go to the center of town for a scene. You eventually get to wander

Be sure to go back to the Manor of the Wicked for the items I mentioned

down and across the ditch for [[Usable|Red Sage]] and [[Usable|Saffron]]. Come back later for a
Giganto in this very spot. Now head back and take the upper trail.

Hug the edge till you go right. Get the [[Deadly Horn]] at the end and return to
the main trail. Keep going, ignoring the paths you can't take yet. You'll
eventually go uphill. More chests you can't reach, unfortunately. A ways up is
a [[Usable|Lemon Gel]] that you can reach. Soon after is a small scene. Keep going,
grabbing the [[Crimson Phoenix +1]] along the way. By the bridge is a chest with
[[Usable|Treat]] and [[Usable|Specific]] in it. A bit hidden at that.

The bridge leads to another screen and scene. Backtrack a little and get the
[[Usable|Melange Gel]] next to the bridge, then head to the next one and grab the
[[Grand Scepter]].

In the next screen, take the eastern path for a [[Transform Bow]]. On the northern
path, take the [[Aries]] before heading to the next screen. Here, keep going till
you nab the [[Tribal Guard]]. Take the upper western path for a [[Pandor]] with a
[[Limit Bottle]] inside. Head back down and take the upper east path now. Grab the
[[Usable|Red Lavender]], save, and watch the scene.

Tison's fast and furious, and Nan likes to cast *and* attack.
She ain't bad at both, lemme tell ya. Never let up on these two. They
both additionally use moves that get them stuck in the ground. When that
happens, just walk up and give them a whack on the head. Tison's a bit
harder to get, so try to be behind him when he uses his own. Once you get
both of them, you've completed the secret mission. Simple enough. Not so
simple is when they decide to Mystic Arte your ass. It hurts. A lot.
Otherwise, all you have to worry about is their deadly combos.

While the battle gets easier after one is down, you may be waiting for
your chance to strike for the secret mission. Watch out for Nan's
resurrection.

This is not a good battle to have multiple casters in, though the AI for
melee people is really dumb. Especially Judith, who is sadly forced.

Before heading in the cave, head to the west for an [[Ever Blue]]. Keep going for
a [[Feather Coat]]. You're done here, so go in the cave now. Scene...!

: <Drache> YES! YES! Finally, a real method of transporation.

Talk to everyone, then watch the scene. Now test out your new ride...

In the middle of the desert is a spiky rock thingy. Go there. Afterwards, go to
Aspio. Feel free to uncover most of the map on the way ;)

There, speak to a Krityan in the center area as you enter. You need to walk as
Judith for this (the Special Flag you got from Nan and Tison, if you didn't
synthesise it earlier, lets you do this). Then go to Rita's hut.

After you're done, go to the middle continent to the south. Roughly southwest
of Aspio. You'll see a stone thingy in a foresty area. And you can see
Nordopolica from there (they're terribly close to each other).

Or you can do moar sidequests first. I recommend this one.

** In the same tavern, be sure to speak with the right barkeep and take the job. Now go to the inn and speak with the lady inside. Walk to the bridge, then exit to Heliord. Talk to a girl in the lower part, give her what she wants, and return to Dahngrest for your prize.

Go along the path, grabbing the [[Usable|Panacea Bottle]], the [[Gaia Cleaver]], five [[Magic Lens]]
along the way. You'll eventually come to some knights. After you mop the
floor with them, go up the hill to the high bridge, and be sure to grab that
[[Mythril Helm]]. Across it, you'll get a [[Usable|Tent]]. At the top are a couple of knights.
Kill.

After the scene, go back to the fork where the first knights were. Cross to the
right now. Before you enter the cave, get the [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] and the [[Queen's Whip]]
to the left. On the other side of the cave, take the downhill path for a [[Life Bottle]]
and the slightly uphill one for ''3000 Gald''. Go straight now and you'll
come to a save point. So, head right then north for [[Turquoise]] and a Fake full
of ''9000 Gald''. Now go for the south path, then left for a [[Mythril Circlet]]. Pass
by the Giganto on the right path for [[Mythril Boots]].

That Giganto is horribly hard at this point. So I *mean* PASS by. Run away for
a skit though ;P

In the next screen, head northwest past an enemy for an [[Overdrive Warrior]].
Nearby is [[Usable|Sage]]. On the southern path is [[Usable|Lavender]] and [[Usable|Red Saffron]].

Back to the save point. Head up the cliff for a [[Usable|Melange Gel]] and moar knights.
And the next area.

Just enter it from the big guy's back ;)

Karol is a nice healer, if you haven't used him. Not as good as
Raven or Estelle in some regards, but nice. Anyways, he's pretty strong,
but nothing you can't handle, assuming you have a good supply of items
for the extreme cases. Just gang up on him and hammer him with spells.
It's one against four - he's easy to stagger. Just nail him on the wall
and attack attack attack! All you have to watch out for his his hard
hitting attacks and extreme speed. Don't be afraid to use nice items.

One thing you do want is a decent amount of health until he uses his
Mystic Arte. Afterwards, hit X to backflip up (if you have the right
skill), run at him, and attack. You'd better be swift, or else you won't
get the secret mission! Attacks like Moonbeam, Azure Storm, and Gale Dog
are lovely. You probably want to be close to him for most methods. If you
end up that close, you'll want to use something like Destruction Field,
as your attack MUST be strong enough to break his barrier.

Oh, and Hourglass. That item ring any bells? I've heard it helps.

Well, crap. Drache forgot items. But that's okay! The losers sell items. If
you got at least one Air and Geo stone, you can make the [[Limit Quartet]], which
is nice for overlimit level 4. You will be a god at that level. Srsly. Right
next to that Tweedle is a walkway that leads to [[Naginata]].

Anyways, continue along that path and go down the stairs. You'll come to a
level with a [[Usable|Life Bottle]]. Keep goin'. Get the [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] and head in the
door. Head forward for a scene. Bigger and better Sorcerer's Ring. Hit the door
with it for a [[Usable|Holy Bottle]] and a [[Reflex]]. The two doors to the left have a
[[Wonder Symbol]] and a [[Usable|Melange Gel]]. Down the stairs, use the machine to the left.

Go through the big door. Scene.

Head to the right door on the same level. Grab the [[Usable|Panacea Bottle]], and go up.
After a few levels, you'll come to a [[Usable|Treat]]. Enter the door up the stairs.
Follow the path until you reach a ladder. Push the block to the next screen,
destroy the wall with the Socerer's Ring, and push the block over the edge.

Hit the yellow contraption at the south with the Sorcerer's Ring. Head down
the ladder next to the stairs, then up another ladder for a [[Guardian Stamp]].
Head to the south end of that platform and hit the blocks as they come along.
Your aim is to destroy the machine below.

Head down the ladder, then down the one to the left. There's a little metal
thing heading down to a lower level. Stand right next to it and fire the ring
to make another block fall on a machine. Go back to the main bridge where you
have broken some [[Usable|Barrier]]s, and hit the machine at the very end. Now go back
to where you were, and down the last ladder. Move the lift to the upper level
and push the block on top the last machine. Kiss this puzzle goodbye. Go to the
bridge and save.

the door, you'll get a Rose Whip. Down to the save point for a scene. Grab the
[[Usable|Specific]] and head up the stairs for a [[Usable|Tent]] and the next room. There, go north
and destroy the wall for a [[Capiora]] chest full of ''10000 Gald''. On the other end,
destroy the wall for a [[Vagabond]]. Enter the elevator. The northeast stairs lead
to a [[Usable|Pineapple Gel]], and the left to a [[Usable|Lemon Gel]]. Go up the stairs to the
blastia now.

Sweet, cutscene. Leave for the southeast exit. Holy crap.

Yuri's awesome points increased exponentially!

Out the Inn for a scene. Then go back and speak with everyone. Leave town after
restocking on items and such.

Strategy: Gah, I suck at using Karol. Just focus on staying alive through
that bit. Eventually that bit will stop (THANK GOD). Free run is your
friend, lover, god, etc.

So let's get the real party started. Shame you have to use Karol for this
fight. Occasionally, you'll see a fin sticking out of the ground. Hit it
three times for the secret mission. This guy is otherwise cake. Really.
The only major problem is that he flies, and I hate all enemies that fly.
As long as you can hit him, there should be no problem. All you have to
watch out for is the attacks that hit anyone under (or above) him.

No more using Karol. Haha. Grab the [[Body Paint]]. To the east is a [[Bloody Coat]].
The southeast holds a [[Usable|Seal Bottle]], [[Usable|Pineapple Gel]], and [[Psychedelica]].

Go all the way back and head north. You'll come to a fork that goes a bit
south. Take it for a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]. The other path takes you to five [[Usable|Magic Lens]]
and a fork. Go left for a [[Usable|Lottery Gel]]. Once you get it, take the southern fork.

Now get the hell outta here.

Lens her twice!

...I wish she could have so much HP when she's with us! Anyway,
use the Mother's Momento on her if you have it on round two. It's for the
secret mission. This is something I did not have first playthrough ;_;
Still, it's a case of four on one, and she ain't the strongest. She
shouldn't suprise you too much. I had four melee people pounding on her
at the edge of the battlefield, and it worked out more than just fine.
She's a pushover with low HP.

As for part two, try to get her against the wall. She's considerably
harder alone. If she overlimits, run like hell XD Azure Edge is nice,
especially if you've used it over 600 times like I have XD

Rita and Estelle will be by the wings in the same area. Karol and Repede are in

From there, head right, down. Talk to the man in yellow. You'll find your party
next to an exit the next day. Estelle is a Determined Princess.

Drache finds that fatal strikes come in VERY handy here. More so than other
areas. She gets lots of grade from doing them so often too. Anywho~!

Make a right and grab the [[Usable|Barrier]]. Head towards the Save Point and check the
vent (how classic!). Go in and down the stairs, then take a left. The north end
of the next room has a lot of chests, full of ''15000 Gald'', a [[Usable|Panacea Bottle]],
''20000 Gald'', [[Moon Cloak]], [[Zaude Orb]], [[Usable|Special Gel]], [[Usable|Life Bottle]], [[Usable|Limit Bottle]], and
a [[Splash Dress]]. Not bad. Head back to the other room and go to the center path.
Check the...thing...and hit it with the Sorcerer's Ring. Pretty cool, eh?

Head northwest for a [[Usable|Pineapple Gel]]. The next room leads to a [[Dunamis]], and the
east exit leads to a [[Usable|Lemon Gel]]. Head back the way you came, and find a scene
to the southwest. Go up the stairs and explore the room for a [[Rare Protector]]
and a [[Rare Plate]]. Enter the north door. Save, and enter the next door.

NOTE: Yeager has two "forms". Lens them both!

Raven. You want Raven. Anyways, this guy has some killer combos
but you can take him. He's also uber fast and has ranged attacks to boot.
But all you really have to do is gang up on him and he'll die soon enough
without a ton of effort. If he's getting to be a problem, just find an
arte that will knock him over. I find that Lone Wolf Storm is nice, but
that's an altered arte.

Once you drop his HP enough, he'll show his "true" power. This is when
Raven comes in. Use his Rain to blow up his heart after his guard is
broken. Simple enough, eh? You'll want to watch out in this part though.
His MA may look cool, but it certainly hurts! To make his guard break, I
hit him with Destruction Field many times during overlimit, then switch
to Raven and spam Rain as Yeager is keeled over. It's hard - probably the
most annoying Secret Mission.

* Drops: [[Splash Bow]], [[Alexandrite]]
* Experience: 12000
* Gald: 6000
* Secret Mission: Annoying. Oops. Hit him with Rain when his guard is broken during part 2 of the battle.
=-=
Y'know, I think Yeager is hot in anime form, but in-game...not so much. Yuri
and Flynn though? Oh yeah, always hawt. He says Wunderbar at the end, meaning
"Wonderful".

Also, you notice how he says stuff like "symphony", "abyss" and "legend"?
Lololol. He's totally referring to other tales games.

I suggest going back and healing before you go on. In the next room is a
Giganto. Holy crap. He's very much defeatable though - just make sure to bring
Rita, and perhaps Estelle. He's weak to light and dark. Estelle spares you
from using up your Life Bottles and gels. You'll get a [[Rod]], [[Mjolnir]], and [[Shiden]]
for your trouble.

: <Drache> The easiest answer to the Giganto is "Blah blah blah Violent Pain!" and a few Pineapple Gels, maybe. With enough of them you can get MASSIVE LP. Just think - normally he gives 30. I ended up with 75.

Head to the right. You'll eventually come to a room with the water switches.
Head up the stairs and push the block off the south end of the platform
- you need to push it on top the square at the south end of the screen. Now
hit the blue thing to raise the water. Notice that the block rose with it? Go
push it to make a path across, then hit the red thing - BUT FROM THE LEFT SIDE
OF THE CRACK IN THE FLOOR. You'll sink to a different level from there.

Through the doors, you'll pass a pedestal on the way. Keep goin'. At the bottom
of the stairs, you can push the block to make a path to the [[Usable|Melange Gel]] and
[[World Charm]]. Anyways, push the left most block all the way to the right and
into the water. Then, push the one with the orb all the way to the left and
down. Stand on the one you pushed in the water and hit the orb with the ring.
Claim your [[Red Orb]] and [[Usable|Lemon Gel]], hit the red thing with the ring, and leave.
Place the orb in the pedestal you passed before, hit it with the ring, and go
all the way back down (you can leave from the left room).

Now go through the center door. Claim your [[Asura]] and [[Death Contrast]] and head
through the door for some knights. Fight, scene, save. Yes, save. Through the
last door, and...

Make sure you got the skills off Dein Nomos. You're gonna lose it.

Strategy: He has some hard hitting attacks, but he's just another, normal
case of four on one. He does have some techs to watch out for, such as
his ice attack, and many of his attacks hit behind him. He's slightly
difficult to get staggered, but just keep hacking away with all you have
and he'll crack eventually.

After a while, he'll use Brilliant Cataclysm, his MA. IT HURTS. Hope you
are behind him when he uses it - only my Yuri was alive at the end of it.
Knock him down right after he uses it while he's still recovering
afterwards. No, I don't care if no one else is alive, just do it.
Overlimit level 4 can help you survive easier. Much, much easier.

Do note that you *may* have to wait for him to nail you with said MA more
than once. Some have to wait as many as six. So when he goes into
overlimit, have him attack someone else, but always be behind him. The more
he uses his MA, the more time you have to whack him because he's tired.

Yeah, this is officially a lot more annoying than Yeager. Three MAs hit me :(

Oh, and he uses words like "reborn" and "destiny".

Sit back, relax, and...watch. Gotta love those fake endings, eh Tales?

When you regain control, head outside. You'll come to a scene near the stairs.
Survivor title for Yuri. Woot. You'll rest. Estelle must have slept with him,
cuz she was in the party in the morning ;P Head up the stairs for a scene.

: <Drache> New battle theme! But I greatly prefer the old one. Golden Sun 4eva

Now for a few places to be!

First, Aspio. Just head up and you'll hear Rita. Follow Ms. Blind to her house.
She's such a tsundere :D

Now to Dahngrest. Head to the central area for a scene, then to the Union HQ.

|* World Map |
* There's a few new enemies all over.
+
* Marking Map
** If you had Repede piss on half the map, you should have a scene. It's very much possible earlier than this.
+
* Dragon Race
** Fly over Mt. Temza for a scene. You can also do this during a sidequest in Dahngrest, so no rush.
+
|* Yumanju |
* Hot Spring
** Pay 300000 gald. Personally, I waited till I could exploit gambling on Nam Cobanda Isle. Don't worry, I'll tell you about it ;) Save gald for another quest.
+
|* Capua Torim |
* Casey
** Go to port to find Gauche and Droite.
+
* Drake
** Now speak with a woman south of the item shop and donate your savings. 500000 gald. Cough it up. 'Fraid you'll miss out if you don't donate now, so give up Yumanju for now and sell your organs for money. Now leave to the west and get the Noble Princess title. On my most recent run, I had to sell all my gels. I was left with 1584 gald. ;_;
+
|* Heliord |
* Talk to the shopkeep for three titles (upon synthesizing the costumes). You automatically get the costume from earlier ;) But go ahead and take your time on getting the items.
+
* Sicily
** Go below to find Sicily. Fight a a good deal of battles and return to get Barrelow X. Follow him and get, er, Karolow X.
+
|* Mantaic |
* Antlion
** Kowz. Get gels. You really shouldn't be using these items very much, but it is possible to synth them should you not have them. The items come from Abyss cameo monsters ([[Gentlesinger]]/[[Gentlereplica]]) and from [[Superstar B]].
+
|* Zaphias |
* Rebuilding the Union
** Find Leblanc sitting on a bench. Raven gets the Imperial Knights Captain title.
+
* Dark Enforcer
** Head to the upper quarter to find Shel.
+
|* Myorzo |
* Bush Baby
** Head to the back of the Elder's house for a scene (Bush Baby Doll).
*** Examine it again for another scene.
+
|* Aspio |
* Bush Baby ~ Final
** Head to the Krityan for a scene. Estelle learns Astion.
+
* Collector's Book
** You should easily have half by now. We're not quite at the point of no return though. Remember, the scene is by the inn.
+
|* Zaude |
* Casey ~ final
** Go to where you fought Yeager to fight Gauche and Droite. Be sure to save beforehand. You get [[Divine Cannon]] and [[Letter of Challenge (L. Claw)]] for the coliseum.

STEAL FROM THEM. STEAL STEAL STEAL FROM THEM. Some skills can make things
easier to steal. Steal Plus, for instance. If you aren't using Repede, be
sure to have Thievery on a shortcut. Thief's Tattoo apparently helps as
well, but you get that from a later boss. If you fail to steal from both,
it's ok. You can synthesize the other using the one you got. Oh, and if
have trouble with even that much, overlimit spam is your friend.

These two are sure to be a little tougher than the norm. They're fast and
hard hitting. You can hold off this battle for a little while if they own
you badly. I suggest tackling one yourself and making your allies attack
the other. Be sure to use your MAs as often as possible, especially if
they're close to each other (feels good to hit them both!). Don't be
stingy with the items either. Once one falls, however, the battle becomes
all the easier, and the other will follow.

I find that having Raven over Estelle makes the battle go better. Unless
you don't use Rita at all. Two full-time casters is too much.

=-=
+
|* Dahngrest |
* Bunny Guild
** Head back to the HQ and help the guy spread word about his Guild. You should have enough titles to start this sidequest by now, but it's possible to have started it earlier. You get [[Girly Bunny Ears]] and [[Bunny Guild Badge]].
+
* Go to the left tavern and talk to one of the guys behind the bar. You'll get [[Ghasfarost, Basement Key]]. Then go to the left machine at the tower to get to the basement. [[False Dein Nomos]] and a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] are waiting for you.
+
* Toys
** Go to item shop and talk to the (...) guy. You get [[(C) F Statue]], a [[Poison Ward]], a [[Stun Bracelet]], and a funny skit about the Statue XD
+
* Marking Map
** Talk to the cat on the bridge. You may need a lot of the dog map marked. Not sure.
+
* Guild Quest
** Talk to the man by the east entrance, then go to the man near your ship in Capua Torim. Back to the Dahngrest Inn and talk to the girl. Now to the top of Mt. Temza! To the right of the warp is the [[Everlight Ore]] (it's a small red dot in a crater). Report to the man in Capua Torim for your cash.

** With that out of the way, return to the guy behind the bar, then run off to Zaphias to speak with Leblanc near the fountain (he may be on a bench in another area if you didn't do that sidequest). Now wander off to the Inn and talk to the lady. To the Manor of the Wicked, then speak with the man near the entrance in Dahngrest. Back to the Manor, then Zaphias' inn. Pick ''I'll pass'' and find Leblanc, then back to Dahngrest for money.

** Speak to the bartender. Again. Then speak with the two people in the corner of HQ. Now to Baction. Once down the ladder, head north and break the wall (if you haven't already) and navigate down to BF2. In this new part, there's little wiggle room, so you'll find the shovel to the south without a problem. If you followed my instructions earlier, it's the unexplored room. Back to HQ for money.

The dreadful icy place. Yes, there. You have to approach it from the east side,
however... So, just head back to that huge spiky thing where the boss battle
was a while back. There are new enemies in the area to boot. You can hit the
icebergs with the ring for new items. See the checklist for what they are.

Anyways, before you check the thingy, be sure to save. You'll go through a
minigame thing. Huh, it's a reoccurring tales theme (after the minigame, that
is).

You'll get the [[Death Contrast +2 alpha]], [[Dark Avenger +1]], and the [[Moonstone]]. You
can miss a couple to get all items, but the less you hit, the less items you're
rewarded with.

Rita gets the Spirit Hunter title. Leave for a scene.

** Speak to the kid to the right as you enter the door. Minigame time. Ugh, level 3 gets you the ability to land on ice. Level 5 is the most difficult, but generally, there's one in every region of the world. This one should be done in order of the circles. If you skipped a circle, you missed one, so remember that area! Judith gets the Super Dragon Rider title and an [[Ultimate Red Cape]]. You have to do Level 3 in order to complete the dog map.

** Sleep at the inn and talk to the kid again for Judith's Into the Sky costume. Only works if you have 1000 FS Chains, 200 of which are blue. Easiest way to get the title is to use BLAH BLAH BLAH TIDAL WAVE and other cheap tricks using minimum damage skills. AKA Grade Grinding.
+
* Sundering Moon
** Speak with the Elder.

===Phaeroh===

Alright, time to move on. Go to the area where his crag is. You'll find him
flying about. Fly near him for a scene. Scram. Why does this have its own
section? I think it's slightly less obvious than some other destinations.

There's not much new left in the world, yet... The next place is to the north
of Capua Torim.

What an interesting place.

Grab the [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] from the east, and move on.

The north fork leads to a breakable crystal - with a [[Sephira]] inside =) Be sure
to equip it. Eventually you'll come to another breakable one for a [[Usable|Melange Gel]].
Make your way across the breakable field of them to the east. You'll eventually
come to a wide area with a huge crystal. Break it to make a bridge. Grab the
[[Stun Talisman]] before you cross.

Once across, head north and break the crystal for a [[Rare Protector]] and a [[Cowboy Hat]].
Take the northeast path for a scene. Save, and break the nearby crystal
for a [[Dark Avenger]]. Head south for a [[Highlander]].

Head north for a [[Quadra]] chest full of ''25000 Gald'', then northeast. You'll come
to two [[Usable|Lemon Gels]] and two [[Usable|Pineapple Gels]].

Head east. You'll eventually be allowed to come south, which brings you to a
[[Strike Eagle]], [[Spinning Drill Hammer]], and a [[Sword Whip]]. The north path will lead
to a Giganto and [[Usable|Red Savory]], [[Usable|Basil]], and [[Usable|Saffron]]. Head back to the fork a while
back.

Now head north and save. Grab the [[Orochi +1]] and the [[Longinus]] to the northeast
beforehand, along with the three [[Usable|Life Bottles]] just up ahead.

Notice his M. DEF is super low in comparison to everything else
- oh Riiitaa~! Anyways, this guy is HUGE. He easily staggers you. You're
a fly, really. Wind/Fire artes are HIGHLY recommended for this guy, as
opposed to the regular hack 'n slash. His ground shaker attack is pretty
annoying when he decides to trap you in one, however. He uses a wide area
water attack that is *extremely* annoying towards the end.

As for the secret mission, Shining Fang works wonders. He has to have his
tail retracted first, then watch for the beating chest thing. Have his
attention kept on another fighter, and as he starts his evil tech, come
from behind and spam Shining Fang. It works like a charm, I swear!

If you feel up to it, now is the time to beat the Giganto.

Otherwise, leave.

Follow the path down you'll find a [[Pandor]] full of a [[Forte Staff]]. Further along
is a fork. Go down the right one to get a [[Bahamut's Tear]]. Back up and to the
left now. You'll come to a [[Usable|Life Bottle]]. It'll lead you to a [[Dragon Protector]].
Follow the southern most path to the east to get a [[Death Slinger]]. The other
eastern path brings you to a [[Kritya Circlet]] and a [[Hero Coat]].

The southwest path takes you to a [[Usable|Pineapple Gel]]. You'll come to a fork. Go all
the way to the east to find [[Alexandrite]]. Back to the fork...

Go southwest for a scene. Grab the [[Sonic Cleaver]] and save. Head east from there
till you get to a narrow path you can walk up for another [[Pandor]]. You'll get
[[Dragon Mail]] for the trouble. Just to the east of there is a [[Star Rod]]. At the
fork, two [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]s are waiting for you. To the west is a [[Dragon Helm]]. Head
east for a [[Usable|Melange Gel]], [[Usable|Apple Gel]], and [[Usable|Orange Gel]]. Keep going till you get to a
save point.

Enter the cave and follow the path. Very nice, and a scene goes with it. Sorta
reminds me of the selenias from Abyss, having no sun and all...

Strategy: She's surprisingly easy to get against the wall. Just surround
and pound on her. She *will* get some hits on you, but really, she's
pathetic. Even in overlimit. Only a couple attacks are annoying, but that
is why you should have Raven/Karol/Estelle/Guardian Field around. When
she's on her last leg, you find that she uses bigger, badder attacks.
That's really the only time you should worry about her.

...While she's in overlimit, she'll do a big attack where she rises then
drops to the ground, creating a big quake. Be as close as possible to her
when she does this, and make sure to hit her before she gets up, but only
after she hits the ground.

As you enter, there's a red plant to burn. Claim your [[Usable|Sage]] and
[[Blue Talisman]]. Go up the tree root till you reach the light. Go west from there
and you'll eventually make it to the ground. Continue till you burn a plant.
Ahead you can burn another one for [[Usable|Savory]].

Return to the light from a while back and go down this time. In the next
screen hug the right side till you go up the tree root. Take the upper
branch and burn the two red plants to the north and east. You get [[Usable|Lavender]]
from the chest to the north. Now take the lower path to get get the
[[Overdrive Old Man]]. Burn the plant to the south to get a [[Mysterious Piece]].

Go back to the save point and burn the plant north of it to get [[Usable|Red Saffron]].
Head up the tree root to the north, then take the northern fork towards a
new plant to burn. To the right is [[Nebilim]], the main prize. Head left and
burn the plant, then go south for [[Blue Dice]] and [[Paralysis Charm]]. Now go to
where Duke saved your ass and burn the plant to the left for [[Elemental Goggles]]
and some a very hidden [[Usable|Chamomile]]. Take Mr. Green out.

====Capua Nor====
%
And amidst the sidequests is a non-sidequest section!

No one's around. Head to the inn, regardless. After the cutscene, waltz back in
the inn. Dramatic music. Try to leave for a scene.

And now you see why I warned you about stuff in Aspio. You can do anything but
the aforementioned Collector's Book sidequest in Halure now.

And yes, that is totally the final dungeon over there.

You can go to Nam Cobanda Isle now, but I'll direct you there later. There's
plenty to do there, regardless.

|* Zaphias |
* Fly over the it for a scene.
+
* Enter and head for the fountain (or to the middle area, depending on where you entered). To the castle!
+
|* King of Adventure |

* King of Adventure
** If you defeated all nine Gigantos, you go here. You'll get items by talking to Rich, assuming you beat the necessary Gigantos (the only ones you may not have seen at this point are the two on the World Map - Griffin and Brutal).
*** Griffin (east of Yumanju), Griffin Feather.
*** Brutal (between Halure and Deidon Hold), Boomerang Horn.

* Sleep there after getting all the items, then talk to Rich again. Karol gets the Valiant Swordsman costume.
* Afterwards, talk to Rich's father by the shop in Capua Torim, then return to Rich.


===Northeastern Hypionia/Aurnion===

* Speedrun/Low Level Playthrough Time: 10:25

Head for the middle southern continent. Scene =) You fight a ton of enemies,
nonstop. Have fun. Lots of LP from that. And items. Afterwards, sweetness.

He was gone as soon as he came =( Bye Flynn. I still think Yuri is sexier, but
you sure were good yaoi fodder on the cover. ...Well, he was!

Save before leaving, cuz that point is forever gone after fetching. Leave for a
scene.

: <Drache> There are actually THREE save points in that area. This one, then the next after Aurnion is actually built, then after you improve it through a sidequest. Guide Dang It. Oh wait. ;)

I like Dahngrest, so let's go there ;) The destination is fairly obvious, the
Guild HQ. In the room the furthest away is a scene. Be sure to talk to the
Bunny Guild guy for an item (assuming you have enough titles).

Also, a sidequest will trigger there. Go ahead and accept the job, but I'll
give details later.

Alright, Nordopolica now. You'll enter to a scene with Natz. Well, that's
over with.

====Aurnion====
%
Go back to Northeastern Hyponia to find a town sprung up. Behold the power of
Kaufman! You'll eventually gain control.

On the east side of town is the Wonder Chef, who'll teach you the Crepe recipe.

There's a [[Usable|Specific]] and [[Usable|Treat]] in the Inn. Rest, then go ahead and talk to Flynn.
Restock on items if you're low, save. Follow him out.

=--Boss: Flynn--=
 |   HP   |  TP  | P.ATK | P.DEF | M.ATK | M.DEF | AGL |  Weak  |   Resist   |
 | 126200 | 2200 |  615  |  620  |  400  |  425  | 220 |  -  | Wind, Light |

* Recommended Level: 55-60

Strategy: Hang back, let him use *every* arte. Enjoy the music. Etc. Yes,
even his Mystic Arte. After he uses *that*, attack to let him use his
healing artes. Anyways, his attacks don't hurt terribly much, but he can
easily combo you to oblivion. Free Run is your best friend here.

Ah, right. His MA is easily triggered - just use your own on him and he
will activate his instead. Sucker ;) He'll use it on his own as well.
List of artes: Demon Fang, Tiger Blade, Sonic Thrust, Sword Rain: Alpha,
Beast, Dragon Swarm, Guardian Field, Demonic Chaos, Demonic Circle, First
Aid, Holy Lance. Holy Lance always goes after First Aid, and he doesn't
seem to be fond of using Guardian Field till he's losing.

He's only dangerous during overlimit, otherwise, don't be afraid to get
near him and let him have it! But be sure to snag him in the biggest
combo you have: I had 6x attack-> Skill Change-> Arcane-> Base-> Arcane

* Drop: [[Order of the Imperial Honor]], [[Alexandrite]], [[Paladin Cape]]
* Experience: 10000
* Gald: 10000
* Secret Mission: Get him to use all of his artes.
=-=

:<Drache> My favorite Tales music... Fury Sparks <3
:<2017 Drache> Man have my tastes changed. And also Shiina does it better.

Anyways, go forward for a scene. You can grab a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] in the HQ room.
Afterwards, just go to the inn.

Oooh, Ring a Bell~! Music is <3

: <Drache> Rita, hitting Karol actually lowers his IQ. Do you realize you're just making him worse?!

===Sidequest Insanity===

You have a lot of work to do.

Need gald for sidequests? No problem! Just go to Nam Cobanda Isle, save
outside, and play for just 10 chips in poker. When you win the chance to double
just keep doing it for a while until you make lots of chips. Eventually you
can win big time. This is where saving comes in. When you win a good amount
of chips, save and go back. After a while, you'll have a ton of chips...and
you can buy all the gels to make loads of cash (takes a while though). Sell
them at Yumanju for it to go a bit faster.

=--Note...--=
The dog map can end now. Be sure to go to the areas you couldn't land on
before. Lakes have been dried up, rough terrain has been flattened. And
all monsters on the world map should be availible to you now. [[Usable|Tents]] are a
wonderful way to change the weather, so I suggest monster hunting as you
finish up the dog map.
=-=

Do yourself a favor. Save.

And do not save over it till you have Brionac in your inventory.

===The Ancient Tower, Tarqaron===
* Speedrun/Low Level Playthrough Time: 10:44
|* Items |
| [[Usable|Holy Bottle]] x3 |
| [[Usable|Dark Bottle]] x3 |

Grab the three [[Usable|Holy Bottles]] and [[Usable|Dark Bottles]] and move on. This looks pretty
awesome. Cue cool music. Holy crap. Look at all the paths. Imagine what it
takes to FAQ this place! ;) Eh, well, it's really not that bad aside from the
initial aimless wandering <_<

====Optional 1====
%
|*+2 Items |
| [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] | [[Ancient Ribbon]]      |
| [[Sacred Chain]]        | [[Usable|Life Bottle]]  |
| [[Crusader 13]]         | [[Usable|Specific]]     |

| [[Ninja Dog Mask]]      | [[Terra Crest]]         |
| [[Usable|Life Bottle]]  | [[Usable|Magic Lens]]   |

Head to the east. When you stand on the platform, a bridge appears. Head down
the stairs for a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]. A [[Sacred Chain]] is in the opposite direction.
Head up more stairs. Grab the [[Crusader 13]] to the left and head south. Grab
the [[Usable|Treat]], and head down the north stairs for a [[Ninja Dog Mask]]. Back up, yank
the [[Usable|Life Bottles]] to your left, and exit to the south. Get the [[Ancient Ribbon]]
and head down. At the bottom is a [[Usable|Life Bottle]].

Through the door, on your right is a [[Usable|Specific]]. To your left is a [[Magical Ribbon]].
Now back to the initial room.

Take the northwest path up. Go down the south stairs and to the left. In the
middle of all the pods is a [[Terra Crest]]. Grab the [[Usable|Magic Lens]] by the pillar of
light things.

====Not Optional====

| [[Usable|Treat]]         | [[Usable|Special Gel]]   |
| [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]  | [[Elemental Ribbon]]     |

Head up the northeast stairs. There is a [[Gungnir]] next to the nearby pod. Next
to the light column thing is a [[Usable|Miracle Gel]]. Head south down the stairs. To the
left of the next pod is a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]. Exit to the south and go up the stairs.
There are three [[Usable|Nectar Bottles]] and [[Usable|Syrup Bottles]] near the top. In the next
screen, break the crystals with your ring and move to the right.

The first chest holds a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]. Head south from there and follow the path
for [[Rune Mail]]. Now go back to where you broke the crystals. Take the north path
this time. Head north past the foutain and to the right for a [[Usable|Specific]] and
[[Usable|Treat]]. Now go back to the fountain and take the west path. Follow it to the
next section. Head upstairs and then to the northwest stairs for a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]].
Run up the other set of stairs now. On the way you'll snag three [[Usable|Lemon Gels]]
 and a [[Warrior's Principle]]. Enter the door on the left.

Once inside, go right. Check the plant things for a [[Usable|Red Basil]]. Now run off to
the left and into the center part. Hit the ball nearby with the ring. Do it
with the rest of them, and be sure to grab the [[Usable|Life Bottle]], [[Usable|Miracle Gel]], and
[[Rare Boots]] as you do. I'm also told that there is another item, [[Mystic Symbol]],
hidden next to the hole.

Now exit to the right. Grab the [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] and save. Go way up the stairs,
grabbing the [[Usable|Special Gel]] and [[Elemental Ribbon]] along the way.  Enter the left
door. Guess who?

This guy is easy. No, really. His attacks shouldn't hurt very
much. I soloed him for a while with Yuri to get the secret mission, and
deaths were pretty rare. Just block his attacks and watch out for his MA
and you'll be just fine. Trust me. You've seen him four damn times before
so one should think you know what's coming by now!

As for the secret mission, you want to hit him right after he uses Blatia
Bane - DO NOT CONFUSE THIS FOR ANY OTHER BLASTIA ARTE. He has several. He
will charge up in black and say "C'mon" several times. Just give him a
whack afterwards - and I mean very soon afterwards. He'll look tired for
just a split second. It's a very narrow time frame.

 * Drop: [[Demon's Seal]]

 * Gald: 19000

|*+2 Items |
| [[Effecti Ring]]             | [[Usable|Lemon Gel]] x3      |
| [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]      | [[Usable|Pineapple Gel]] x3  |
| [[Caladbolg]]                | [[Usable|Panacea Bottle]] x5 |
| [[Energy Wand]]              | [[Rune Jacket]]              |
| [[Usable|Limit Bottle]]      | [[Usable|Miracle Gel]] x3    |
| [[Usable|Special Gel]]       | [[Empress Dress]]            |

Walk out the west way, taking the [[Effecti Ring]] and a [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] with ya. On
the outside, get the [[Caladbolg]] and head down the stairs. You'll eventually
start going upstairs. Get the [[Energy Wand]] and enter the door to the right at
the top. Moar new enemies ftw.

Run to the west and hit the blue thing with the ring. Grab the [[Usable|Limit Bottle]] and
hit the next one. Beat up the monster and hit the switch. Hit the next thing.
Head back and hit the switch to the right to claim your [[Usable|Special Gel]]. Now back
to the initial fork. Grab the three [[Usable|Pineapple Gels]] and [[Usable|Lemon Gels]] and hit the
switch to the east.

Eventually you'll come to five [[Usable|Panacea Bottles]] and another switch. Hit it and
keep following the path. Yup, another one. Grab you a [[Rune Jacket]] and keep
going. Eventually you'll get to the last one.

Go all the way back to the other side now. There's a shortcut. There will be a
new path to the west. Grab your three [[Usable|Miracle Gels]], hit the switch, and return
to the east. A new path has opened up, leading to a switch and an [[Empress Dress]].
Roll your eyes at the game (and Drache). It's okay. Go back to the path
between the two paths to find a path to the north (yay).

HIT ME BABY ONE MORE TIME! I hope I reminded you of awful things. ;)

Go forward for a scene. Save. Before you go to his Final Bossiness, however,
you may want to do a few final things.

If you suck, you might as well finish the game now, or at least avoid the Fell
Arms.

====Optional 2====

As for the rest of you, there are two more Fell Arms to go fetch. Among other
items. If the final boss pwns you, you might want to go get some of this stuff.

=--Note...--=
THIS WILL MAKE THE FINAL BOSS EVEN HARDER. Though you *could* defeat him
the cheap way, which I will explain later on.
=-=
If you need something from outside, go up the stairs and right to get to the
elevator. Too far foward and you'll trigger the final battle, so be careful.

|* Sidequest! |
* Schwann Brigade
** Walk as Raven. Equip the Shining Star title. Remain this way till you hit a scene (it'll be after getting the Kritya Coat, which is very soon).
%

Go all the way to the east in that switch-hitting area and you'll find that a
new path has been opened.

You end up outside. Go down the stairs for a [[Glorious Guard]]. Before you enter
the door that you pass, go down more stairs for a [[Mumbane]]. You'll eventually
make it to the room you beat Zagi in for a [[Usable|Red Chamomile]]. Leave through the
east exit. Yes, you are looking at more stairs to go down.

Take the left stairs first to get the [[Milky Way]], then chip away at the other
side. Grab the [[Kritya Coat]] before you get to the next area. If you walked as
Raven, you get a scene here. Head south, then go to the west after the bend
(through the crystals) to get a [[Terra Crest]]. Continue south to a new area. Moar
stairs. They lead to a [[Laurel]]. Through the door to the awesome room.

Head west till you find a small platform. When you stand on it, a bridge
forms. Cross it, get the two [[Usable|Pineapple Gels]] and [[Usable|Lemon Gels]], and use the lift.
zomg a lift. The two chests hold a [[Usable|Miracle Gel]] and a [[Golden Hammer]]. Stand
on the circle thing to make a bridge. Puzzle time. This is where the
Sorcerer's Ring comes in.

I'll be frank. I can't possibly lead you through this. I often go all over the
place just trying to find my way around, and there's no method to my madness.
Have fun. Burn the nets to get around. You get treasure: [[Usable|Special Gel]],
[[Prism Protector]], [[Usable|All-Divide]], [[Usable|Limit Bottle]].

Drache, several years later version: I'll never live this part down. I know it
sucks, but I have no 360 to fix it. I'd also like to make maps, but
the same issue applies. I did have something written up for here a long time
ago, but when I tried it myself I didn't understand it at all. So I cut it
out and just never got around to fixing it. Why? Hell if I know! Maybe one
far out day in the future I'll play the PS3 version...

Eventually, you will be forced to come back through another walkway. Head
downstairs. Stand on the black thing in the floor to activate a bridge.
There's another to the west.

=--Note...--=
YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. Pick up at your own risk and potential frustration.
=-=

This is where you grab [[Uroboros]] and [[Susanoh]], the final two Fell Arms.

Go up the west stairs. I won't lead you through, but... You need to head left
and up the stairs to a new walkway, and hit two switches. You shouldn't climb
many ladders. On the way back, get the [[Usable|Red Verbena]]. Take the stairs at the
bottom of the area that you just activated to a new area. Get the three
[[Usable|Special Gels]]. Head up the other stairs now for a [[Meteorite Blade]]. A lift is
now active.

Take the southeast platform to level 7 to get straight to the final boss.
Level 6 takes you to the save point. If you want to unlock the left lift, go
to level seven, walk *straight* across to the left, and use it. Too far up and
you'll trigger the final boss fight, so be careful.


====Sidequesting====
%
Oh no she didn't!

That's right. Leave for moar sidequests. As you get to Ba'ul, you should get a
scene about the Fell Arms, and having all of them.

I'm mainly putting this here because you probably didn't have Great Leo Fangs
for a certain sidequest in Aurnion. But by the time you cleared Tarqaron to
this point, you likely have a few from the lion enemies.

|* Halure |
* If you dealt an absolute crapload of damage, Rita gets the Seeker costume. You may have gotten this earlier. Probably not. It's a LOT. Hell, I had to continue grinding for this. On my second playthrough, anyway.
+
|* Aurnion |
* Fell Arms ~ Final
** Enter for a scene with Flynn.
+
* If you haven't already, give the knight next to HQ what he wants till he's satisfied. Go out of town or sleep in an inn. If that doesn't trigger the scene, just let a day or so pass. Return for a scene. You get the [[King's Cape]].
+
* When it's rebuilt, go in the inn and speak with the doctor. Go right back in after the scene.
+
* Speak to the man near the inn's owner.
+
* Go out then back in Aurnion. Go towards the inn. If no scene occurs, do a battle, go into overlimit, spam Nightingale with Estelle. You must have healed 10,000,000 HP with Estelle. She'll get the Dedicated Paramedic title.
+
* Warehouse ~ final
** Another warehouse. Have fun, sucker. This earns Karol the Warehouse Master title.
+
|* Nam Cobanda Isle |
* If you got all the collectable figurines, speak with the Antlion at the entrance. By now you must have opened most of the chests of the world, so speak to him again. Yuri gets the Treasure Hunter title.
+
* Go in the shoe locker to find Kaufman. There is no continuation of this scene, sorry. But at least it doesn't turn into another Cecille and Frings sidequest either. (I'm talking about Abyss here.)
+
|* Zaphias |
* Talk to Ted. Yuri gets the title Hope of the Town and [[Claiomh Solais]].
+
|* Yumanju |
* Hot Spring ~ Final
** Equip everyone with their spa titles for a final scene.
+
|* Dahngrest |
* Master cooking with all HP/TP foods, but have three stars for the rest. You can enter the cooking battle :) And yes, you only have to master cooking with one person. Unlike other tales games that expect you to waste your life away. Yay titles! For the record, this is the only tales game I have bothered with cooking in.
+
====Beat the game!====
%
Alright, you know where Duke is. Get up there.

=--Boss: White Haired Pretty Boy?--=
| Enemy |   HP   |  TP  | P.ATK | P.DEF | M.ATK | M.DEF |  AGL  |  W  |  R  |
| Duke  | 286500 | 4000 |  762  |  750  |  690  |  704  |  712  |  -  |  -  |
* Recommended Level: 60-70 (depends on skill level)

Strategy: He can warp. That's really the only thing that's special about
form one. He's extremely easy to combo to oblivion. If you use Yuri, the
Super Chains and Glory are your best friends. Basically, just chase him
around the battlefield and let him have it. Don't worry about a thing.

| Enemy  |   HP   |  TP  | P.ATK | P.DEF | M.ATK | M.DEF |  AGL  | W  |  R  |
| Duke 2 | 467500 | 6000 |  808  |  880  |  760  |  754  |  744  | -  |  -  |
Ah, here we go. Round two, fight! This time, however, you have to watch
his HP at the end. You MUST finish this guy with a Mystic Arte. Other
than that, you'd better give this guy your all - especially those of you
who didn't collect all the Fell Arms. If you did, you may want to hold on
to many of your items and such for a bit longer.

This guy is a heavy hitter. That much is certain. He's also harder to
stagger. MUCH harder. Krona's Symbol is lovely. And anything along those
lines. You want lots of items otherwise. But honestly, whack this guy
with everything you have; it's harder than last time, but it's very much
possible. I even took off my beloved Glory skill to see for myself. When
he nails you with Big Bang, use a Treat IMMEDIATELY.

* Secret Mission: Kill him with a Mystic Arte.
* Drop: [[Last Fencer]]

| Enemy  |   HP   |  TP   | P.ATK | P.DEF | M.ATK | M.DEF |  AGL  | W |  R  |
| Duke 3 | 528200 | 10000 | 1100  | 1150  | 1256  | 1078  | 1126  | - |  -  |

You should be 75 or higher for this. Well, the non-cheap way.

If you feel like you fail at life, use an All-Divide. This guy is brutal.
He's entirely optional. Also, if you don't have Glory or something like
it, have fun. I'm not crazy enough to do that on my first playthrough at
level 69 and lower! On higher difficulties, this guy is plain cheap, but
on normal, he's basically a stronger - much stronger! - version of the
same thing. And make sure you can cure every status ailment under the
sun! Way too cheap.  Be very happy that Big Bang doesn't kill.

However, he may use an MA that will once his health is low: Brave
Vesperia. I've personally never seen the MA on normal difficulty, but
I've been informed that it happens sometimes. So the way to avoid being
killed by it is by spamming Gale Dog or Force Field with the Eternal
Support skill on.

The Cheap Way: Rita. O.L. Boost + Light Magic + Spell End. Meteor Storm.
Go into overlimit, spam Meteor Storm, trigger OL again, spam Meteor Storm
and keep doing it. You can win at about any level XD
=-=

===Ex Dungeon and More===

Unlike earlier Tales games (at least the ones I played), you can continue from
where you left off. You'll be back at Tarqaron. So first, for you
completionists, the most monsters you can have right now is:

* 89 Humans (assuming you ran through the 100 man melee with Karol and Yuri)
* 47 Beasts
* 31 Birds
* 37 Magic
* 23 Plants
* 28 Aquatic
* 26 Insects
* 18 Inorganics
* 13 Scales

The rest can be found in the 200 man fight at the coliseum and the Labyrinth of
Memories.

====Aurnion====

* Drake ~ Final
** But before you do anything, go to the west side of Aurnion to find Ioder for Estelle's [[BC Rod]], which is her best weapon.
** Then go speak with Flynn if you completed all the secret missions for Yuri's True Knight costume. You may have to leave town and reenter to see it (I did!).

: <Drache> *snort* I prefer Dark Enforcer, but I guess it isn't bad.

You can do certain other sidequests if you missed them, mainly those in
Aurnion.

====Ex Dungeon====

Now, for the Ex Dungeon... well, go to Phaeroh's Crag, then to the Sage at
Yormgen. To Dahngrest! Once you see the scene, fly to the west (to Yurzorea)
for a scene on Ba'ul. You'll now see a little black warp thingy below you. Be
sure that you're prepared!

To get through to the end, you need 15 [[Fake Gald]]. You may have to pass through
multiple times. You get them randomly from bosses and from chests. Be sure to
lens the new enemies and all bosses ;) Refer to the map by NakarG from
GameFAQs. It'll get you through better than I can.

http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/945075/54060

To open chests, fight enemies. This also makes the warps appear. Once you make
it to Yeager or Schwann, or Alexei or Duke later on, you can leave. The warps
are a more gold color. I find that fighting more bosses gets you more Fake
Gald, though you still have to be lucky. So fight them all at least once for
the Monster Book, and if you still need gald, go for the routes with Giganto
monsters. I can't tell you anything that will increase your chances of getting
gald. Sorry.

Additionally, you don't have to take every path to complete the book, you just
gotta fight all the bosses.

This place is good for grinding to boot. And the gald you get is tremendous!
Put Sephira on everyone (and as many Blue Sephira as you can) and watch the
money climb to 10 million for the achievement. Personally, I got 5 mil on a few
runs. On 10x exp, this area also makes grinding to 200 a breeze =P

But the echo and blur effect are obnoxious.

So, once you get 15 gald... Here comes Kratos! Though he doesn't go "Hee hee
hee", normally. His official name is Traitor to Heaven, but the box is going to
call him Kratos.

=--Boss: BLAME YOUR FATE--=
| HP   |  TP  | P.ATK | P.DEF | M.ATK | M.DEF | AGL  |  W  |  R  |
| 512000 | 3800 |  869  |  950  |  820  |  775  | 520  |  -  |  -  |

Wow, he has all his obnoxious combos still. Yes, you'll find
them obnoxious too. I swear this guy doesn't stagger for long either. He
likes to simply jump outta them. However, he's fairly easy. Shining Bind
is the only real thing to look out for, as it can kill you if you aren't
high enough in level (I was nearing 100).

He has the ability to stun you. If that happens, expect him to completely
pwn you, even if you have Glory (and you should by now!).

His ability to heal himself is annoying, but keep trying to smack him and
he'll die eventually.

* Experience: 30000
* Gald: 15000
 =-=

You'll get the [[Letter of Challenge (Legend)]] for winning. And an Achievement.

====King of Adventure====

If you've been everywhere on the map, including all four Aer Krenes and the EX
Dungeon, rest here for Estelle's Curious Princess title.

====Coliseum====

Now be sure that you beat the 100 Man Melee with three people. It's absolute
cake near level 100 ;P I even did it with *Estelle* with four minutes to spare.
I hate using Estelle. She's the worst character battle-wise, even with her
uber shield.

You might want to synth some Rebirth Dolls for the big one. You'll want to be
very careful. I can't come up with strategies for all the characters. But I can
give very general tips. I'm frankly not good with everyone.

So things to know about each character:

* Yuri
** Destruction Field, Dragon Swarm, and Azure Edge are three of my favorite moves. And they're fairly good for spamming to boot. You'll want any skills that increase your combo size (Yuri has a bunch). Oh, and Glory is the most amazing skill. For healing, you can use Guardian Field (an altered arte). Dhaos Blast is also great for enemies, if you beat the 200 man fight with someone else before Yuri.
+
* Repede
** Gale Dog makes you invincible for a little while, but I find it's useless when not dealing with Mystic Artes. I can't say that you can spam just a single move with Repede, especially when the enemies fly. For those, there is Victory Light Spear and Shining Fang. Hell Hound is probably another one I very much like. For healing, Repede has a skill that heals his HP and another for his TP during Free Run. If mages give you trouble, Repede is fast enough to run right up to them.
+
* Estelle
** Ew. She's terrible, but it's very doable. You probably want Holy Rain or Angel Ring. But first, utilize the Eternal Support skill. At the beginning of the battle, go into overlimit and spam Force Field. Hopefully you'll be invincible for the remainder of the battle due to the skill. If not, try again? Then you can do the whole OL magic spam again with Holy Rain. Taunting helps refill the guage. Alternatively, you can also spam Dividing Edge and occasionally Delight Roll. Oh, but whatever you do, don't have Anti-Magic on her.
+
* Karol
** He seems difficult, but he really isn't. Nice Curing Smash is amazing for healing. Roaring Revolution will sort of make up for Karol's terrible speed, and Reaper Knock is seriously awesome. Especially with his skills that allow for the charging of his attacks (you can have three baseballs coming out of Reaper Knock by charging it). Just come up with a few short-range, non-rolling attacks to fill in the gaps for bosses.
+
* Rita
** BLAH BLAH BLAH TIDAL WAVE. Or Meteor Storm, depending on the enemy's weakness.
+
* Raven
** Change Skill 2 helped me so, so much. I spammed The Wind's Howl the entire time. I suck at ranged >_>
+
* Judith
** I spammed Moonbeam so much it isn't even funny, but you gotta be strong enough to one-shot a lot of enemies.
+
* General
** Be very careful with Barbatos. NO ITEMS EVER! You'll definitely want a [[Rebirth Doll]] to lens him.
** [[Miracle Bangle]] is great for characters who eat through TP quickly (KAROL).
** You'll also want a [[Krona's Symbol]] for the parts where enemies pop up that can petrify you.

So, obviously some of my strats may not do it for you. So I have a solution!
I refer you to the Coliseum Guide or to the sticky:

http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/945075/58930

http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/genmessage.php?board=945075&topic=50753071

It's because I suck terribly. Sorry XD

And if these two links don't help you, take it to the boards.

If you wanna know who you're fighting, that's Dhaos (Phantasia), Shizel
(Eternia), Kratos (Symphonia), and Barbatos (Destiny 2).

Coincidentally, my very last monster was the second occurence of Nan.

For 100% completion, you must do the 100 man with everyone but Rita, and the
200 man with *everyone*.

====Halure====

* Collector's Book ~ Final

At this point, you should be able to get all items if you don't have them
already. You'll know when you get them all because the achievement will pop up.
Go to a mage in Halure for Estelle's Itemania title.

Aaaaaaaand that's it. :D Be sure to check out the achievements section for the
odds and ends not covered.

==Monsters==

This is, really, a location list. Why? Because if you really, really want to
know something, you can figure it out easily after you find one. That, and I
have everything you really, really need elsewhere.

And, like items, you can search by number.

Also, a searching tip. Sometimes you won't find the monster you're looking for
walking around on the world map. They'll be in that area, but they'll be in a
group with other monsters.

If you can't find something in the rain, try night. It generally works.

===Humans===

Only 116 of 'em.

==Miscellanea==

For the stuff I didn't tell you about, mostly. It'll help you complete crap.

===Cooking===


There are 36 recipes overall. For the Cooking Battle sidequest, you need to:

* Get the first 35, then go to Nordopolica to find the Wonder Chef for Mabo Curry.
* Master all HP and/or TP recipes (with one character).
* Get three stars for all others (with the same character).
* Go to Dahngrest for the battle and titles.

One person's cooking nets you all the titles. But don't use Repede, whatever
you do. Yuri is the best option because he's always around, but it can easily
be done with others. Also, don't cook the same thing twice in a row. It makes
things go faster.

Anyways, you can find 14 recipes all over the world, but you have to cook for
the rest. I've listed how you can get every recipe below.

* ''Sandwich'' (auto)
** ''Rice Ball'' (make sandwich with Estelle)
** ''Beefbowl'' (make Rice Ball with Yuri)
*** ''Omelette Rice'' (make Beef Bowl with Karol)
**** ''Meat Sauce'' (Omelette Rice with Karol)
*** ''Pork Stew'' (Beef Bowl with Raven)
**** ''Japanese Stew'' (Pork Stew with Judith)
***** ''Sukiyaki'' (Japanese Stew with Judith)
+
* ''Vichyssoise'' (Find at Nam Cobanda Isle)
** ''Pork Miso Soup'' (Cook Vichywhatever with Estelle)
*** ''Udon Noodles Hot Pot'' (Pork Miso Soup with Yuri)
+
* ''Salad'' (Find at Ghasfarost)
** ''Sashimi'' (Make Salad with Raven)
*** ''Sushi'' (Sashimi with Karol)
** ''Vegetable Stir Fry'' (Salad with Rita)
*** ''Soup Noodles''' (Vegetable Stir Fry with Raven)
+
* ''Fried Chicken and Fries'' (Find at Capua Torim)
** ''Scottish Eggs'' (Fried Chicken and Fries with Estelle

+
* ''Minestrone Soup'' (Found in Dahngrest)

===Achievements===


You'll definitely unlock many just as you go along. But y'know, you always
gotta go the extra mile for the rest.

|* Character Study          | 10                | View all skits (easy as long as you buy the skit option in the grade shop and visit Nam Cobanda). This is impossible to do without the grade shop option. Don't even ask how. |
|* Piggybank                | 10                | 10,000,000 Gald. You heard me. Easy to get with a Blue Sephira on one person and regular Sephira on everyone else in the Ex Dungeon. And, of course, with the chests in that area as well. |
|* Big Game Greenhorn       | 20                | Kill a Giganto. |
|* Big Game Hunter          | 50                | Kill all Gigantos. |

|* To Points Unknown        | 10                | Travel a very long ways. Basically, tape your control stick down while on Ba'ul and leave the game on for a very long time. Unfortunately, distance traveled doesn't transfer to other playthroughs. |
|* Item Nerd                | 30                | Get all items. Can be done in a single playthrough if you're careful. |
|* Eureka!                  | 10                | Synth your first item. |
|* Little Mad Scientist     | 10                | Synthesize a lot. |
|* Too Much Free Time       | 20                | Play for 100 hours. |
|* Back Up Plan             | 10                | Saved at all points. |
|* They Call Me...          | 30                | Get all Titles |

|* Grand Battles            | 10                | Kill 1000 enemies. Easy to do if you hunt for monsters and fight almost everything in your path. |
|* First Strike             | 20                | Use a fatal strike. |
|* No More Grinding         | 10                | Get to level 200 with one person. Easiest way is to buy 10x exp on a second/third/whatever playthrough. |
|* Low Level Challenger     | 10                | Beat Barbos below level 15. This is only possible by using the 1/2 EXP option in the grade shop and not fighting more enemies than you have to. I recommend doing this with Speedster; transfer weapons, skills, and use the grade shop option that lets your skills cost one point and go for it. Early in the game, I suggest using Vitality skills. Easy difficulty will also help, especially for large bosses. |
|* Speedster                | 15                | Beat the game within 15 hours. I did it in 11. It's doable in under 10. Hold X and A during cutscenes to speed through them, use as many holy bottles as you can (and Repede has a skill that extends the effect), and run run run. If you don't do this with Low Level Challenger and you think that you won't be able to beat the game easily, then 10x EXP isn't a bad option to buy. Do that, and be sure to grind to 200 in the Labyrinth of Memories (meaning do just one sidequest). |
|* Vesperia Master          | Yay               | Get all other achievements. |


===Tips & Tricks===


You may or may not have noticed that I have a bunch of neat things to say, but
they're scattered. Well, here they are, in one place. And an additional glitch!

====Gald 1====

The earliest trick for gald is at Nam Cobanda Isle (lol late game). Basically,
you gamble for chips. Start with the initial amount of chips (10) and keep
gambling for more. Eventually, you'll win a decent amount of chips. Save till
that amount is HUGE and not in danger of draining dramatically at multiple
attempts at using the max bet.

Then, simply, buy up all the cheap (usable, non-equipment, though you might as
well buy those once for the title) items and run to sell them at Yumanju. It
takes a lot of trips back and fourth, but you'll have all the money you need.

====Gald 2====

This second "trick" is much more basic and comes later in the game. It's more
geared towards the money earning achievement. Go to the Labyrinth of Memories
and equip Sephira and Blue Sephira on everyone. You'd be surprised at how much
money you get by the time you're done.

====Infinite Combo====

Two controllers needed. It's a simple matter too. Just have one person go into
overlimit and hack away (with the minimum damage skill equipped), and have the
other taunt (remember, there are skills necessary for this). The OL gauge fills
fast enough to keep overlimit going.

The other method... look at grade grinding. And even then, there are other
methods I've never even attempted. I'm sure message boards are dying to tell
you. And youtube.

====Grade====

BLAH BLAH BLAH, TIDAL WAVE.

And that's the gist of it. What, that's not enough? Oh fine.

* Rita
** Minimum Damage, Light Magic, OL Boost, OVL Bonus 2, Spell End skills.
** Wonder Symbol (or Shizel's Necklace) should be equipped.
* Everyone Else:
** Taunt 2 and set them to defend.
** And as many Blue Dice as you have equipped. I guess having Limit Bottles wouldn't hurt.

Ok, now overlimit BLAH BLAH BLAH, TIDAL WAVE! BLAH BLAH BLAH, TIDAL WAVE!
...ad infinitum. Do remember, this IS a 360, what with the RROD. So don't do it
endlessly, even if you can. The FS Chains are what boost the grade up to this.

Coincidentally, without the minimum damage skill, this is more or less how you
get Rita through the Coliseum and how you can beat the final boss cheaply.

====Stealing====

You think I'm going to say much here? Well, I'm really not.

It's as simple as going into overlimit and spamming Thievery. Perhaps with the
Theif's Tattoo equipped.

====Item Drops====

Think of less extreme grade farming. Merely accumulate FS chains in the proper
direction (dependant on monster type) and finish them off. The more FS chains
you have, the greater their effect will be. Hunter's Monocle may help.

|* Enemy Type     |* Blue FS   |* Red FS    |* Green FS  |
| Human           | EXP^       | LP^        | Drop Rate^ |
| Beast/Magic     | EXP        | LP*        | Drop Rate  |
| Bird/Insect     | LP*        | Drop Rate^ | EXP        |
| Plant/Aquatic   | Drop Rate^ | EXP        | LP*        |
| Inorganic/Scale | EXP*       | LP*        | Drop Rate* |

: * Indicates that it's more difficult to trigger.
: ^ Indicates that it's easier to trigger.

====Invincibility====

Other than OL 4, that is. Number one method is to use Gale Dog.

Number two is more interesting. Use the Eternal Support skill on Estelle and
go into overlimit. Spam Force Field. The result is that, eventually, your
characters will retain the effects of Force Field for the rest of the battle.

Oh, but be sure to avoid the Anti-Magic skill.

====Mumbane Aer====

It's... not necessarily a beneficial glitch (it won't harm your game!), but I
might as well mention it. Synth Mumbane Aer when Repede has the Aer Fragment
equipped. He'll be wearing Mumbane Aer instead of Yuri :D

Brush Spear is obtainable by using Moonlight Blast 300 times, and by
equiping the Deck Brush and Glamorus Maid.

Mind of Brush is obtained by holding the attack, arte, and guard buttons
during Brush Spear.

What are these? Beats me. I don't like using Judith enough to find out.


* Moonlight Talon

** Or 100 man melee, apparently.

| Sundering Moon         | Event   |                                       |

More weird. Equip the Deck Brush and Glamorous Maid. Then hold attack,
arte, and guard during Sundering Moon for an extension. It can be
extended from Luna Havoc as well after using it 400 times and Sundering
Moon 200 times.


* Sundering Moon

** Then go to Mt. Temza when the final dungeon pops up.
