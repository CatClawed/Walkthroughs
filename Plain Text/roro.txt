    Atelier Rorona: Alchemist of Arland         Latest Update: GameFAQs.com
             FAQ/Walkthrough                                   Neoseeker.com
   Copyright 2016 Drache the Dork/Chloe B.
—————————————————————————————————————————————


Version FINAL - I will no longer be supporting this guide. Please enjoy the
—————————————   Plus version instead.


Q. Can I use this guide for the Plus version?
—————————————————————————————————————————————
  Sort of? I can't totally recommend it. The Plus version is a harder game. It
  is not as easy to make high quality items, so you struggle with friendship
  more, and the assignments are handled somewhat differently as well,
  despite being the same on paper.
  
  The events are the same, with the addition of a handful of Esty events.
  This is basically the aspect of this guide that you can follow without
  issue.
  
  The ending system is different, and the character friendship requirements
  seem to cap at 60, outside of Tantris who requires 80. This is just hearsay,
  however. As far as endings go, you'll have an easier time in the Plus
  version because they literally removed the star/trust/friendship garbage
  that I discuss AT LENGTH in this guide, in a dedicated ending section you
  can happily ignore.
  
  Some trophies are different too, but I don't have a list. I do know that you
  don't need 100 friendship across the board, so yay!
  
  Furthermore, there is an entire new scenario after the game's end that
  includes Totori and Meruru. That obviously would not appear in this guide at
  all.
  
  Finally, there is little synthesis help in this guide to begin with, but
  the Plus version has a superior and complicated synthesis system and this
  guide will not even begin to help you with that.


Q. Why won't you update this guide?
———————————————————————————————————
  Several reasons. Rorona Plus has a variety of superficial similarities,
  but it would require significant expansion on my part, probably to the point
  of making a new guide. Of course, I no longer write in the TXT format, so
  I would feel obligated to convert all my existing materials to HTML.
  
  But there's a more fundamental problem at hand. I enjoyed the original
  Rorona, and I still immensely enjoy her character. Almost as much as Totori!
  But her original game was flawed, and after the three runs required to write
  this FAQ I was done with the original. So, then, I tried the Plus version,
  thinking it would be better.
  
  And it is. The problem I had with Rorona, however, was not addressed by the
  Plus version. Synthesis is more substantial, the battle system is better,
  the character models aren't nearly as goofy... but none of that mattered to
  me. What truly needed fixing, and the problem I still have, is the structure
  of the game. That is, the way the calendar, assignments, trust, friendship,
  and events were handled.
  
  And so, in a nutshell... I didn't like it enough. I used to adore the game,
  and tolerated its structure well, but after being spoiled by the likes of,
  well, ALL the later games, I can't go back.
  
  As of this writing, I'm entertaining the idea of Sophie instead.

Pie ending. Or rather, there are a jillion endings in this game, and it's going
to be a royal pain to get them all. Nah, just kidding. This is a Gust game.
Gust is easy.

But really, there are 14 endings (that 30 number is total BS), and they have
weird ass requirements. For instance, you have to fill the requirements for the
"good" ending for certain characters, but the "normal" ending for others, and
so on. You can't get Lionela's ending on the "good" or "true" routes, for
instance.

My guide is going to suggest you do things. You don't have to. This game gives
you LOADS of freedom. Remember Mana Khemia? Same series, some similarietes, but
your schedule isn't laid out for you like before. You can do about nothing and
get the game over screen, if you like. You'll even be rewarded with a trophy.

Of course, if you want all the endings, then you should probably refer to my
guide at some points. The main walkthrough is divided by the kingdom quests.
These are given every 90 days, and you have 3 years in total for this game.
That's 12 quests in all.

However, those quests aren't the only things in the walkthrough. I have many
dates down that mark events.

So, time to save the workshop!

                                `------------´

This game is fairly standard turn-based, so battles should not be an issue for
most folks.


Character Quirks
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Rorona is your only item user, and you're only allowed to have 60 items on hand
(you can have more back at the workshop). Later on you can get 100 items.

+--------------------------------+
| Name     | Fee | Availiblity   | You will, at some point, be allowed to add
+--------------------------------+ several characters to your party, for a fee.
| Cordelia | 0   | Year 1, 1/12  | They will take your money each time you go 
| Iksel    | 50  | Year 1, 1/15  | into a new dungeon. This fee reduces as you 
| Sterk    | 200 | Year 1, 3/30  | raise friendship levels.
| Lionela  | 80  | Year 1, 10/26 |
| Tantris  | 100 | Year 2, 1/6   | As a rule of thumb, the more expensive the
| Gio      | 300 | Year 2, 10/14 | person is, the stronger they are.
+--------------------------------+

But don't worry about it. I beat the hardest bosses with the "weakest" party.


Skills and Elements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
These cost HP to use. This is more significant early in the game.

In the bottom left corner, you'll notice some elements. If you keep using, say,
earth elemental attacks from Tantris, the level will increase. Your weapons
"expand" your skills through Hidden Secret traits. You will get these
regardless of the elemental values.

But they also give you new, unrelated skills, depending on the materials used
when creating the weapon. Look at the Effects for these. When the elemental
level raises enough, you'll get these new skills.

If you raise the level to 5, and you're above Adventurer Level 25, you can do
an uber attack (well, it's usually an attack) at no HP cost. However, don't
expect to see that very often. Most battles end too quickly.

Each character requires different elements, so here's a quick list:

Gio/Sterk       - Wind
Iksel/Tantris   - Earth
Cordelia/Rorona - Fire
Lionela         - Water

Ideally, your party will not have a conflict of elements. Lionela's a great
healer (better than Iksel, and how!), but her attacks mean that Rorona's higher
abilities will never be seen. Using Fire attacks and items will decrease the
Water element level, and vice versa.


Bombs bombs bombs!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Use 'em. They're far more powerful than you are, especially with the proper
traits (I'll tell you what those are when I have you make a Tera Bomb).

Even the worst attacking item, the Uni, is a godsend early in the game.


The RPG Aspect Leads to the Sim Aspect
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You go out to these dungeons to gather ingredients and maaaaybe get a couple
trophies. Monsters can have rare drops, and there's equipment out there
(Victory Charm) that'll help you get them.

For the most part, you'll be gathering and finding new recipes in dungeons.
Once you get Hom, you really don't need to worry about the gathering part.


                               .---------------.
                              |    Synthesis    |
                               `---------------´

The heart of the game. It's actually very easy to get the hang of, and the game
tutorials teach you well enough how to actually synth. You can access those 
tutorials again through the encyclopedia.

But I want to elaborate on a couple things.


Alchemy Level
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As you synth, you'll level up your Alchemy level. Your Alchemy level should be
equal to or higher than the level of the item. Otherwise, your chances of
success go down, similar to having low HP. However...

Synthing something far above your level will give you MORE experience, up to
150% (8 levels below the item's level). When your Alchemy Level is higher, you
will not gain as much exp, down to as much as 50% (8 levels above).


Categories
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Items have categories -- cooking, supplement, liquid, etc. Next to these
categories, you'll find a number. The game tells you to choose the item with a
higher category number when in doubt.

I wouldn't *quite* listen to the game because...

...That has nothing to do with quality. Instead, I believe it has more to do
with Effects which include healing strength and more. But Effects are more
complicated than just that. It's a system I don't totally understand.


Effects
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Most items you synth will have some sort of Effect. While synthing, check the
top left box. If you see ???, you're getting an Effect you haven't seen before.

Effects depend on materials used. If the item demands a Dead Beast, then a
higher quality Dead Beast will likely give you a different effect.

If the item demands [Threads], or any category, really, then Category Number
comes into play. But it's quite often that Category Number and quality are BOTH
changing the effect. You'll see this in Ingots and Cloths quite a bit, where
one Dragon Scale might give you Velvetis (the best Cloth), but another will
give you Scale Cloth (second best).

You really just need to explore through all your items to find out what changes
your effect. And sometimes, you'll have to wait till a later dungeon to get
better materials.


Traits
¯¯¯¯¯¯
The items you gather will have traits attached. When you synth, you can have
up to five traits (equipment will not carry some of these traits, such as Giga
Stink).

You can combine traits to make new ones. However, these require specific traits
and I haven't yet listed many of them. Traits will also cancel each other out.
Narrow Range and Wider Range, for instance, amount to nothing.

You can make traitless items, but I don't suggest it most of the time. Even if
they do nothing else, they influence price somewhat.

The more items you make at once, the bigget trait pool you'll have. You'll have
a hell of a time getting the ones you want in the top five, but this is
important for equipment and for game-breaking Tera Bombs.


Quality
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The highest is not 100. It's 120.

In general, better quality items means a better quality result. But if you
really want to know if your next pie is going to be above 80, here's a formula
for you:


Quality = (average quality) * (1 + (AlchLv - ItemLv) / 50) * (quality modifier)


If AlchLv - ItemLv is negative, then ignore that part.

If it wasn't obvious, average quality refers to the ingredients.


Quality modifier values
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Bad Quality +1 = .9
Bad Quality +2 = .8
Bad Quality +3 = .7

     Simple +1 = .95
     Simple +2 = .9
     Simple +3 = .75

    Quality +1 = 1.2
    Quality +2 = 1.3
    Quality +3 = 1.5

  Pro Favorite = 2
  Beginners OK = 2

Seems strange that I'd put this so early in the guide, right? There aren't any
spoilers in this section.

You seriously need to know this early so that you can determine what you want
to do. This isn't really a strict you-must-follow-or-die guide.

A lot of this reading is for tons of situations. BUT PEOPLE ASK THESE
QUESTIONS. Every time someone on GFAQs asks a question, I put a line in here,
usually. So it has damn near everything there is to know about the end.


      True  - 89/94 or more stars, 80 or more trust.

      Good  - Less than 88/94 stars, 80 or more trust.

    Normal  - 89/94 or more stars, 79 or less trust.

       Bad  - Less than 88/94 stars, 79 or less trust.


Trust
¯¯¯¯¯
Received by doing Front Requests. You can lower this by failing to do a
request, not by giving up. It does go down by giving up, but very slowly.


Stars
¯¯¯¯¯
Depends on your performance on assignments. The ones you see with Sterk and in
your Status, not the big ones.


Star Values are Inconsistent
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Don't believe any one value will always work. Follow my star recommendations
and the warning you'll see at Assignment 11 (make a save, dammit!) and you'll
probably be ok. And make a save at the beginning of Year 3 for good measure!



The following tables describe the ending system further.


Character Column
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You have the highest friendship with that person, and you have done all their
events. Does not include Shopkeeps, aside from Iksy. "None" means you do not
finish the events for anyone. Recommended only for the rich end.


+----------------------------------------+
| Character | True     | Normal  | Good  |   No special requirements.
+----------------------------------------+
| All       | Astrid   | Normal  | Good  |
| Cordelia  | Cordelia | Normal  | Good  |      NOTE NOTE NOTE
| Gio       | Gio      | Normal  | Good  |
| Lionela   | True     | Lionela | Good  |  See below for the Adventurer end
| Tantris   | True     | Tantris | Good  |  requirements!     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
| Sterk     | True     | Normal  | Sterk |
| Iksel     | True     | Normal  | Iksel |
| None      | True     | Normal  | Good  |
+----------------------------------------+


Astrid is Special
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
If you're the type to play once and not "complete" the game, then I strongly
suggest Astrid's end as the one to aim for.

You need to do all events for all characters, regardless of friendship.
                                              ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
If you want to get multiple ends, you should hold off on Tantris and Lionela's
final events so that you don't mess up the Adventurer/Gio/Cordelia ends. Astrid
has a higher priority than all other ends.
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Triggering her end acts like triggering any other character end, except with
steroids.

For non-completionists, you want the following Friendship values:

 Tantris - 80
 Lionela - 60
   Sterk - 60
   Iksel - 50 (30 if the cooking battle isn't necessary)
     Gio - 70
Cordelia - No idea. She's too easy to do.

However, this isn't a good idea if you want more than Astrid's end. You should
have them all even if you want more ends. 100 or 80 are good values to aim for.
100 is easier to manage.

Completionists -- 100. Even for shopkeeps.


Astrid is EXTRA Special
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Keep in mind that triggering her end will prevent character ends, even when you
lower yourself to Normal/Good ends. So hold off on the final events of Tantris
AND Lionela to ensure you can get all ends.


Adventuring
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
For the Adventurer end, trigger Cory's end, but also do some more. Get Cory and
Rorona's Adventurer levels to 50 and defeat Demon and Iron Giant. No other
monsters required, but you might as well go kill them.

FYI, you have to have high friendship with Cory. That's part of triggering her
end over other ends.


+----------------------------------------+
| Character | True     | Normal  | Good  |  Finish with 1 million cole.
+----------------------------------------+
| All       | Astrid   | Normal  | Good  |
| Cordelia  | Cordelia | Normal  | Good  |
| Gio       | Gio      | Normal  | Good  |
| Lionela   | True     | Lionela | Good  |
| Tantris   | True     | Tantris | Good  |
| Sterk     | True     | Normal  | Sterk |
| Iksel     | True     | Normal  | Iksel |
| None      | Rich     | Rich    | Rich  |
+----------------------------------------+


Money Money Money
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Quite unlike the Pie end, don't finish off any character's events.
                          ¯¯¯¯¯
It's wise to have a save at Year 3, 1/1 if you intend to do this with other
ends. You cannot trigger an end before that day.


+----------------------------------------+
| Character | True     | Normal  | Good  |  Bake every pie... under certain
+----------------------------------------+  conditions.
| All       | Astrid   | Pie     | Pie   |
| Cordelia  | Cordelia | Pie     | Pie   |
| Gio       | Gio      | Pie     | Pie   |
| Lionela   | Pie      | Lionela | Pie   |
| Tantris   | Pie      | Tantris | Pie   |
| Sterk     | Pie      | Pie     | Sterk |
| Iksel     | Pie      | Pie     | Iksel |
| None      | True     | Normal  | Good  |
+----------------------------------------+


Everybody Likes Pie!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Finish the events for at least one character.
                      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
And make every pie at 80 quality or above. You need Iksy for Swirly Shells
(Nabel Lake) and Mystery Mushrooms (Catacombs).

This complements the Rich end well, oddly. Don't take Iksy to one of his
required dungeons, and use Lionela/Tantris (they're quite useful!) to control
whether you get the Rich or Pie end. Don't trigger the Normal end, obviously.


Shopkeeps Get No Love
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
All shopkeeps may be ignored with regards to the end except for Iksy. It
doesn't matter if their friendship is thirty million over Cory's, you can still
get Cory's end.

There are benefits to raising their friendship, but that has nothing nothing
nothing to do with the end.


Power of Friendship
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Make sure the person whose end you want has the highest friendship level.
Well, it's really dependent on character hierarchy (see below!).


Friendship is Powerless
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Friendship does not affect the end when you have not triggered the end of X
character.

In other words, if you have Lionela at 100 friendship and Tantris at 99, her
friendship value won't interfere with getting Tantris' end.

She will ONLY interfere if you did her final event.
                                       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Ending Priorities
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Here's the grand priority list:

      Astrid > Adventurer > Character > Pie/Rich > True/Good/Normal/Bad

      Cordelia > Sterk > Iksel > Lionela > Tantris > Gio

For instance, Sterk is considered "higher" in friendship than Lionela, even if
they're both at 100. If you want Lionela's end, you'll be getting generic
Normal instead. Lower Sterk's to 99, and you'll get Lionela.

If you want Gio's end, but you've fulfilled the requirements for the Pie end,
then chances are, you're getting the Pie end unless Gio's friendship is above
all others.

This is all under the assumption that you've done all character events for the
relevant people. Friendship is, again, otherwise ignored.


One End at a Time
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Meaning you have to listen to the credits till you go nuts. Create backup
saves. And many of them. I suggest 1/1, 7/1, and 10/1, all in Year 3. I'm not
going to micromanage the rest of your saves. Figure it out yourself.

                               Character Events                        [00004]
_______________________________________________________________________________
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Each character has events to go with them. You must see these to get their
ends, except where the characters don't have ends (Tifani, Hagel...).

There are other events, but I don't know how to trigger a lot of them. Often,
if you have friendship past a certain point and/or go out with them, you'll
trigger an event. Also, switching your party around and going out of town will
lead to some events between party members.

Those events are entirely optional. The following, mostly, are not.


                                .-------------.
                               |    Lionela    |
                                `-------------´

 • Year 2, 3/1 :: 30 Friendship
      - There will be an automatic event with her.


 • 40 Friendship 
      - Go adventuring for another scene.


 • 50 Friendship
      - Lionela comes to the workshop before friendship is that high.

      - A second event between Cory and Astrid about Lionela will follow after
        friendship hits that point..


 • Year 3, 2/1 :: 60 Friendship
      - Go to areas at Traveler's Way. Eventually (it's random), you'll get a
        scene about Rorona being lost. Two days later, another event will
        follow.

      - A month later, an event will trigger in the square.

      - A week later, Astrid will demand that you make an item after an event
        about the puppets. Make it and fetch Lionela. You'll get the Puppets
        and a girltrophy.

      - I don't recommend doing this event till the bitter end, as it can be
        used to control the activation of so many ends.


                                .-------------.
                               |    Tantris    |
                                `-------------´

 • Year 2, 4/1
      - If you got three big stars on your fifth assignment, there will be an
        event about medicine when you go adventuring.

      - An automatic event will occur after. The medicine is a...! Meredith is
        pathetic.


 • Year 2, 7/1 :: Optional
      - Adventure with Tantris to see an event with Rorona's parents.


 • Year 3, 1/1 :: 60 Friendship
      - Automatic event.

      - A week later, he'll be back for a new scene.


 • Year 3, 4/1 :: 80 Friendship
      - Another automatic event.

      - Speak to Tantris, and you'll be asked to make an item. Make it, and
        you'll get the Duet trophy.

      - I don't recommend doing this event till the bitter end, as it can be
        used to control the activation of so many ends.


                                 .-----------.
                                |    Sterk    |
                                 `-----------´

 • Year 1, 10/1 :: 30 Friendship
     - Speak to him for an event about his job. Then talk to Esty.


 • Year 3, 1/10 :: 60 Friendship
     - At the workshop, he'll warn you about a dragon in Ster Highlands (see
       Cole's events for unlocking it)

       This apparently does not happen after 6/29.


 • Optional
     - If you travel with Sterk a lot, you'll get a bunch of people thanking
       him when you travel.


 • Till Year 3, 7/1
     - Put Sterk in your party and fight the dragon. You'll get a couple scenes
       along the way, if you made it in time. The battle starts automatically.
       Where is the dragon? The area that has dragon in the name, of course.

     - You MUST face this guy before Year 3, 7/1. However, you do not have to
       win. If you lose, you can put off killing the dragon for a long while.
       There is a reason to delay the killing. See Gio's events.

     - Sterk will be out of your party for 80 days. Ouch. You get the Honorable
       Injury trophy.

     - Be sure to have more than 80 days left in the game when you kill the
       dragon. The event in which he returns is required as well.

     - Sterk is required to unlock Orthogalaxen. So unlock it before killing
       Suni Sterm.


                                 .-----------.
                                |    Iksel    |
                                 `-----------´

 • Take Iksel to the following locations for new items to gather:

     (Do related items in order.)

           Nearby Forest -- Mudhead
            Ortoga Ruins -- Triberries
          National Mines -- Some Egg (second area)
      Traveler's Highway -- Sour Apple
               Catacombs -- Mystery Mushroom (A ghost event will happen first)
          Ster Highlands -- Some Egg (second area)
              Nabel Lake -- Swirly Shell
              Dark Woods -- Dreamy Crown
          Night's Domain -- Mystery Mushroom


 • Year 2, 9/1 :: 30 Friendship
     - Iksy will tell you about Dark Woods.


 • After 3 events
     - Go to the Sunrise Cafe for an event.


 • After 6 events
     - It'll steal your day, but go back to the Cafe and get 1000 Cole for your
       trouble.


 • After 9 events
     - Another day Stolen, but you get the Busy Cafe trophy.


 • Year 2, 4/1 :: 50 Friendship
     - After you make a high quality dish, he'll start a cooking battle after a
       few scenes. Skipping this will make his friendship go down by 50, so be
       sure not to miss it!


                               .--------------.
                              |    Cordelia    |
                               `--------------´

 • Front Requests to watch out for (must do 5):

            Pebble x2 -- 1000 Cole
         Iron Clay x2 -- 1800 Cole
     Cotton Flower x2 -- 2500 Cole
     Sunny Crystal x2 -- 3920 Cole
         Glow Sand x2 -- 4999 Cole
        Mont Blanc x2 -- 10315 Cole
      Shadow Grass x2 -- 7350 Cole


 • Eventually
     - Esty will give a request for two Pebbles for 1000 Cole. Accept it for a
       scene, then do it for another scene. Your trust went down by 5%.


 • After 3 front requests :: Year 2, 1/1
     - Find Cordelia at the Sundries store.


 • After failing a synthesis :: Year 2, 7/1
     - You will make a stone. Something way outta your league is ideal, like
       Elixir when you first get it. Do this part as early as you can so that
       you don't struggle to find something to fail. Soon after failing, Rorona
       will give that stone to Cordelia.


 • After 5 front requests :: Year 3, 1/1
     - Esty will finally spill the beans. You'll get a scene with Cordelia
       after leaving the Palace. Cory won't be in your party.

     - An automatic sighing event will follow. *sigh*

     - After that, speak with Esty.

     - Yet another event will happen after leaving the workshop later.

     - Optional: Go to Hagel. Shiny...!

     - 10 Days later, you'll get Cordelia back and the Making Up trophy.

       You cannot equip the item. :(


                                  .---------.
                                 |    Gio    |
                                  `---------´

 • Travel
     - Go somewhere with Gio once. You'll get a scene with him, then with
       Astrid.

     - There is a scene after that in which Gio helps you around the workshop.
       You must see it.


 • Year 2, 12/20 :: 50 Friendship :: Optional
     - There is a battle tournament. Win the Sterk battle to unlock the hardest
       boss in the game - Gio! You don't have to win, even if you do see this.


 • Year 3, 1/1 :: 70 Friendship
     - There will be an event with Sterk at the Sundries store.

     - IT IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT that you do not trigger Sterk's ending before
       this. You can delay the time limit by letting yourself be defeated by
       the dragon.

     - Gio will visit you 15 days later. A week after that, he'll come back.
       Accept, or let Gio be injured for the rest of the game. The enemies are
       low level.

     - You still need Sterk.

     - You get the final event a week later. No trophy.


                                .------------.
                               |    Pamela    |
                                `------------´

 • No friendship-related events, aside from Wholesale. She is purely a cameo.

 • About a month after finding her, enter the Workshop for an event.

 • A couple weeks after her shop opens, visit her. No one is buying. :(

 • Be at the Workshop on the next 15th to see another event with Cole.

 • After that (a week later?), you'll see a bunch of people in her shop.

 • About a month later, you'll have a conversation with Astrid in Pamela's
   shop.


                                 .-----------.
                                |    Hagel    |
                                 `-----------´

 • 30 Friendshiip
     - Go to the Square.

 • 80 Trust :: 80 Friendship
     - Go to the workshop. Astrid will give you a Helmet and recipe later. Make
       his wig, but his shop will close for a bit afterward.


                                .-------------.
                               |    Tiffani    |
                                `-------------´

 • At some point, an event about her being sick will happen when you go to her
   store. This'll happen more than once.

 • 40 Friendship
     - Go to the Sunrise Cafe for another scene with her. Day stolen.

 • 60 Friendship
     - Back to Sunrise Cafe for Drunken Tiffani trophy. Day stolen.


                                 .----------.
                                |    Cole    |
                                 `----------´

 • Buy up to 1000 Cole (possibly more) for an event. Optional.

 • Year 2, 5/15 :: Seen him 3 times
     - He'll open up Ster Highlands.

 • Year 2, 7/1 :: 10 Friendship
     - Come to the workshop with a full basket after this day and you'll get a
       bigger one (limit of 100 items).

 • Year 3, 1/1 :: Friendship 80 :: Optional
     - You'll get a scene.

     - Be at the workshop on the next 15th for the another one.

                                  Walkthrough                          [WLK00]
_______________________________________________________________________________
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

I've been hit with the following glitches:

 • Killing the same weak enemy twice

 • Item drop where you cannot select a bomb that features Japanese text

 • Music stopped during a scene when I left the game idle, but returned after
   Sterk and Rorona stopped talking. And I got it to happen again near endgame.

 • Infinite loading

Only one of those glitches is harmful, but let this serve as a warning.

SAVE OFTEN.

I have a few additional notes as well. If you miss a date, you'll generally
be able to trigger the event later on. Main thing you have to look out for is
character events, which the walkthrough mentions sometimes, but it does not
give details on all the events. See the previous section for that. 


STOP RIGHT THERE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You have enough time to

 • Explore every single area of every dungeon at least once
 • Make every item
 • Get all relationships to 100
 • Get trust to 100
 • And them some

All in one playthrough, if you're efficient. YOU. HAVE. TIME. And lots of it.

And no, NG+ does not give you infinite mode. Your system data holds all your
Encyclopedia entries (a dream for a FAQ writer). Your playthroughs carry over
money, and money alone. No synthesis, items, whatever.

More would totally break the game. This game is ridiculously easy.


Year 1, 1/8
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • After the initial scenes
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Go ahead and leave the workshop for the Palace.

     - You'll be introduced to the assignments and you'll get your first trophy
       eventually. Both Trust and performance on assignments affect the ending.

     - You can fail this assignment, and neglect to do it completely. But only
       this one. I suggest you don't, as you get 0 stars.

     - You do need to fail any other assignment for a trophy though.

 • If you ignored the above ending section
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - I suggest you read it. If you want the best ending (Astrid), at least
       look at the requirements for it. And there's a damned reason I'm telling
       you to do this. You want the Pie end? Read carefully!

 • Completionists, do read the playthrough strategy section. You can wrap up
   the game in one playthrough (er, more like 1.3), if you really want.


Year 1, 1/9
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Tutorial time!
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - The gist of it is that you should be careful with your HP and time.

     - WARNING -- don't use the couch. You waste time on the couch. It's better
       to use items or to adventure. Travel time restores HP.

 • Oh, and say this out loud: Esty Dee. Are you laughing yet?

 • A few notes
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - There will be some suspiciously rewarding requests from Esty. Those are
       from Cory, and they will lower your fame by a whopping 5%. The first
       one will be two Pebbles for 1000 Cole, and you'll get a scene about it.
       See the Character Events section for the full list.

     - The gameplay section has a neat equation in there under the Synthesis
       subsection. It's good if you're aiming for the Pie end, but serves few
       other practical uses.

     - Synthesis tip: Make 5 Supplements at a time, and make them from the good
       Flour and Water you can buy around town. (One Flour and 4 Waters.) All
       of them will have the Quality +1 trait, and you haven't wasted any time.

       Making multiple items at a time will increase the number of traits
       availible, and it will be more time efficient. A supplement takes .2
       days to make, but if you only make one, then you wasted an entire day!


Year 1, 1/12
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Recipes
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Beginning Alchemy (Automatic)
     - First Cookbook (Iksel)
     - Sundries Book (Tiffani)

 • The town has opened up for you
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Enter and exit the workshop for a scene. (This will trigger many other
       events, so if an event in the workshop doesn't trigger, try this
       technique.)

       That will hog your day. After this is a great time to explore town. You
       can buy items, recipes, and more. At this point, however, everything is
       expensive.

     - On Artisan's Way, outside the Workshop you have free water. It's better
       to buy water at the Sundries Shop due to the higher quality, but a well
       is there should you need it.


Year 1, 1/15
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Go to Sunrise Cafe
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - You'll be able to hire Iksel now. He's probably a little expensive for
       the time being, but he's your first healer. You need him. Bad.

     - If you must, sell water till you can afford him. I recommend trying
       virtually everything else first though.

     - You'll want to explore with him for the Pie End. He allows you to find
       two items that are necessary for it.

 • Exploration tips
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Use Uni to attack the enemy. Those items are about worthless, but at the
       beginning they're amazing. Low level life savers. Later, you'll graduate
       to using bombs.

     - You'll notice giant dots on the map. The little dots around them
       represent paths to new areas. If you see three little dots, then you
       want to explore the area three times to find all the new areas.


Year 1, 1/20
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Your first assignment finally comes in.


                             .-------------------.
                            |    Assignment 01    |
                             `-----. WLK01 .-----´
                                    `-----´


  Items: Polish Powder, Zettel, Alchemy Coal. Quantity over quality.

    Due: 3/30

    How: Buy the recipe from the Sundries Shop, and Fest from the Weapon Shop.
         The rest of the ingredients are easily found in the Nearby Forest.
         Just use your worst ingredients to churn out a bunch of Zettels and/or
         Alchemy Coals. You don't even need to bother with Polish Powder, if
         you don't want to.

         Only focus on the bottom set of stars -- the other two sets don't
         matter. Speaking of stars, you need three of them to be filled to pass
         the assignment. Those aren't really good results though.

  Stars: 9


   NOTE: The stars part is a recommendation of how many little stars (the
         bottom row and what you see in your status) you should get on the
         assignments. Following my recommendations will get you to the perfect
         spot to manipulate into the true/normal/good/bad ends. For the most
         part, average to 8.

         By the end of assignment 11, be sure to have 84 stars. Yes, NOT 88,
         for those of you who cheated on me with another guide :) There is a
         very specific reason for this, and I'll beat you over the head with it
         multiple times later in the guide.

 • At the Palace Front Desk
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - You'll be able to do Friend Requests after finishing Sterk's request.

     - Don't ignore the shopkeeps. You miss two trophies, a wig, a bigger
       basket...

       ...and, most importantly, you miss Wholesale. Which I will explain
       later, but it's INCREDIBLY nice. So shopkeeps up to 30 friendship, even
       if you aren't a completionist! Tiffani apparently gives you Wholesale no
       matter what, so don't worry about her or Cole (who you'll meet later).

     - For 100% completion, you want them to 100. It's very easy, as requests
       get more rewarding in friendship and in money later on.

 • Event with Cordelia in Square
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - If your Adventure Level is 4, or if your Alchemy Level is 5, you can go
       to Ortoga Ruins. After you run out of areas in the Nearby Forest, this
       is a great place to go to grind.

     - It should also be noted that there is another Cory event triggered here,
       but I don't know the exact date. You'll know it by a bunch of kids
       bothering her for money.


Year 1, 2/2
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Workshop event. You can now make... Pie! 80 quality or better for a new end.
   Make this first pie good and you'll the Basic Pie recipe. Make those 80 or
   above and you'll get another set of pies. And so on.


Year 1, 2/12
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Enter and exit the workshop for 2 of the following: Mandra Root, Dead Beast,
   Puniball. Bought right outside the workshop, I'm sure.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Go to Rorona's home for two of the following: Beast Fur, Audra's Tail,
   Mandra Root.

   As a note about this, you can go back at a later date to get them if you
   don't get a scene on this day. They'll even leave you a note.


Year 1, 3/30
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • If you did what you were supposed to
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - You get 1-3 big stars and the Assignment 1 trophy.

     - If not, you skip the stars and Astrid saves the workshop with... well,
       you can see for yourself if you're that curious.

 • You can now hire Sterk
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Expensive knight. Are you concerned about Rorona, or your wallet? In any
       case, he breaks your game this early due to his level.

     - If/when you can afford him, I suggest dropping Cordelia. He will make
       getting through Ster Highlands later on so much easier. The sooner you
       get through there, the better. If you want the Adventurer end, I have a
       grinding solution for you later.

       As for droppping Iksy... You can do it, but you'll be forced into
       backtracking some (which is normal, but kind of a pain to do with weak
       party members) and keeping track of where you've taken him if you want
       his end. His element may conflict with Sterk's, but you don't really
       need Slam so long as you have Sterk. Sterk is just that good.

  Items: Bomb, Barrel, Cannon. Quality is better.

    Due: 6/30

    How: Buy Making Cannons from the Weapon Shop. It contains the Cannon and
         Bomb recipes. You can go to the mines for exploration purposes and to
         fetch some ingredients, but you don't have to have high quality.

         In reality, you don't need to turn in bombs or cannons at all. So if
         money is tight, don't worry about it. I do suggest making bombs
         eventually. You need them to blow up rocks.

         You do still need to make Barrels, and those are easy.

   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Making Cannons (Hagel)
     - Beginning Blacksmith (Hagel)

 • Visit the weapon shop
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - You'll be able to make equipment now, and you can go to  the National
       Mines. You'll also get a couple new recipes from him.

     - As a little note about National Mines, there's an area where you will
       need loads of bombs and a really good bomb. I didn't make it inside, so
       don't think that you have to go in there immediately.

     - This is also a good opportunity to use a bomb on that rock in Nearby
       Woods.

 • You get a scene at the Sundries Store too.

 • About Ingots and Cloths
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Play around with their Synthesis. Ingredients will change the type
       (Effect), so keep checking in the top left box. Tinc and Dry Metal are
       what you want, for now.

     - You don't need both Ingot/Cloth Effects that Hagel demands to make the
       items. Lots of people seem to get confused here, but you just need ONE
       and it doesn't matter which.

     - Take your materials to the Weapon Shop to get better stuff. The game
       will be easier just by improving equipment.

     - Right now it isn't exactly relevant, but try to make all your materials
       at once and put the best Traits you can on the weapons. I like the
       Attach Fire/Wind/whatever traits across all my equipment.

     - Through dismantling, you can take your Ingot/Cloth back. You can then
       use it to make another set of equipment. This is good for getting all
       items. However, you don't always get the same Effect back. You may put
       Silvatite in, but get Golteisen back. The Traits will be the same.

    Due: 9/30

    How: Buy Plants & Ores from the Sundries Store for Pure Oil. The rest is
         VERY easy, assuming you've done enough adventuring. Spam the easiest.
         You know the drill. In this case, I found the Healing Aroma to be the
         biggest pain, so I spammed the other two.

     - Ancient Alchemy (auto)
     - Plants & Ores (Tiffani)
     - Chef's Favorite (Iksel)
     - Nature & Bombs (Hagel)

 • Go by the Sunrise Cafe for another event with Iksel.

 • To Rorona's house for 3 Uni, 1 Beast Skin, and 2 Audra's Tails.

 • Talk to Esty
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Regardless of trust, you get a scene.

     - If Trust is over 5%, talk to her again to get a request. Do it to be
       introduced to the roulette and tickets. You can exchange tickets for
       prizes, and these will change each time Esty gives a request, except for
       her next request, which adds Bounties.

     - Taking stuff from Esty does not count towards Item Complete. You can buy
       stuff, gather stuff, and synth stuff, but you can't trade in with
       tickets!

     - Optional: I suggest buying her 80 quality Phlogistons while they're
       there. That doesn't mean you have to get them this instant, but before
       she changes her prizes (her third special request will change 'em and
       it'll come with a scene like this one did).

       Make a bomb, and make it as high quality as possible, over 100. Do not
       use. But don't put a bunch of traits on it. Ideally, none.

       Try to get your Alchemy Level up before making this bomb. That'll make
       it easier to get high quality. If you get 90's... the result will not
       be as good, but it'll work for general use. Bomb Ice is an acceptable
       substitute for what I'm plotting though.

       Later, you can register the Bomb with Hagel to mass produce them. This
       bomb will be later used in a Tera Bomb. An uber, world destroying Tera
       Bomb. It will be the biggest boom in the game. :)

 • Gio comes by the Workshop. You get 200 cole. He hangs around Main Street, if
   you want to do his jobs.

   You need him above 70 friendship before the end of the second year to make
   his events easy and to prevent potential conflicts with Sterk events.

   And you have five trophies to miss if that happens. The only character who
   has more trophies attached is Cordelia, thanks to her additional end.

         not make [Desserts] instead. =\

         On subsequent playthroughs, you might just want to buy up Iksel's

   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Automatic workshop scene. Gotta love Astrid's motives. Poor dummy. I

     - Go to Rorona's home for two Forgotten Bones, Some Sloughs, and
       Pendelooks.

 • With Friends
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - This is as early as I've gotten the first of two Tiffani events to
       trigger at Sunrise Cafe. 40 friendship required.

     - You can also talk to Sterk if his friendship is over 30. Then talk to
       Esty.

 • Talk to Esty if your Trust is over 10%
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - You'll get bounties. :D

     - You can still get the Phlogiston I mentioned.

     - While most enemies listed are ones you've faced before, there are some
       monsters that only appear after you have accepted a request. Watch out
       for them, as they don't show up all that often and you need them for
       the Encyclopedia.

       If you're on a one-playthrough run, you need to be extra obsessive.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

 • Automatic event with Cole
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - You get to buy some good stuff, so consider it.

     - Buy Honey. Make Pie. You might want to buy lots of Honey, because lots
       of requests ask for it with 40+ quality. You can do this later though.

     - His selection changes from time to time. You can reload to see different
       ones, and buying up some Ingots and Cloths for Hagel/Lionela isn't a
       terrible idea. Maybe you can save that for when you're swimming in cash.

     - Try to see him every month till you can hire him in the Square (Year 2,
       1/1) . It's okay if you don't, but I wouldn't wait too long as he
       unlocks a dungeon a bit later (Year 2, 5/15)

     - He will visit on every 15th. His items become less valuble as time
       passes, but it's nice for now.

 • On Main Street or the Square
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Event with Lionela. You can hire her (and her jiggle physics) and she
       opens up Traveler's Way.

     - Lionela is a better healer than Iksel. But if you want Iksy's end,
       Astrid's end, or the Pie end, watch out for where you have to explore.
       Her magic is superior to Iksel's Slam, and she's more compatible with
       Sterk and Gio, the battle gods.

     - At Traveler's Way, be wary of the paths. Some lead out, but not to a new
       area. Watch for the paths that are guarded for auto-attacking enemies.
       Guess which ones you have to go through. :P

     - Try to get some Quake Crystals, Milky Saps, and Cotton Flowers from that
       new area. Also, if the Griffon gives you trouble, there's always Bomb
       Ice.

 • After getting Cotton Flowers, you should get the third Cory Front Quest.

     - Collect 40 cabbages for The Cabbage Girl trophy and a Mercurious Eye.
       You can discard Cabbages to get more.  This is a really easy thing to
       win, so you really don't have to worry about it.

     - You lose 10 days, regardless of whether you watched. And it helps with
       your next assignment, so do it.

         Store if you don't feel like getting it yourself, but you should
         have more than enough of what you need. Could be a good excuse to get
         rid of some cabbages.

         most of it.

 • With Friends
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - To the Square to find Cole. You can accept requests from him on Factory
       Way. You will not see this till you've seen him a few times.

     - You can also meet Tantris by going to the Nearby Forest (other places
       except for the Catacombs might trigger it). You get the The Wandering
       Bard trophy. The following days detail the *earliest* you can get his
       events. You will get them if you fetch him later, don't worry!

     - I suggest going to Nearby Forest and back, then do all the Pamela events
       (which is explained in the next day's section)

     - A Cordelia event will trigger in the Sundries store if you've done
       enough of her trust lowering requests.

       teddy by going through the exit located the furthest from where you
       start, then a couple more areas. You get the trophy, The Ghost and Teddy
       Bear.

     - Two months after you fetch her, she'll open a shop. It's important that
       she opens it soon.

     - Cory will get to meet her sometime after fetching the Teddy (and meeting
       Hom).

     - After she opens her shop, there will be a scene where she doesn't get
       anyone in her shop. Cole will come to save her.

       DO NOT let this event overlap with 5/15, where Cole unlocks Ster
       Highlands. If it triggers between 4/15-5/14, RELOAD, and don't enter her
       shop till 5/15 comes!

 • A warning
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - You cannot cannot CANNOT avoid enemies. It will bite you in the ass hard
       on assignment 10.                               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

     - You need to get to level 20. Again, you want Sterk, regardless of who 
       you sacrifice to put him in. Lionela is ideally in your party, but that
       sort of gets in the way of Iksel's end. You can work around it though,
       even if you specifically do it for his end. He's honestly not terrible
       with Sterk, but battles will last longer.

     - Level... it up. Trust me.

     - I found it less useful for synthing, but it will help you save time.

     - Gathering is better for leveling, as it takes less management. Send Hom
       to higher level areas and watch the results.

     - This event may trigger on later days. I'm not sure what influences it.

     - A Cory event will trigger after getting Hom at some point. She'll react
       like Rorona did. Someone has height issues.

     - You should ALWAYS synth Cloths and Ingots intended for equipment
       yourself. Hom won't do as well.

 • Be sure to get her friendship to 40 and go adventuring with her.

 • Then get it to 50 for another scene.

  Quest: Kill Vultures in Nearby Forest. More is better.

    Due: 6/30

    How: ...Go to the Nearby Forest and raise hell. Each Vulture counts as a
         star, so do 8 fights and you're good. Remember, there are a couple
         non-enemy areas. Cabbages and Uni.

         Alternatively, you can use Wild Scent (recipe from Tiffani) to clear
         entire areas.

   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Stars & Alchemy (Hagel)
     - Mysterious Tools (Tiffani)
     - Lemegeton (Pamela)
     - Escalario (Ster Highlands)

 • Wholesale!
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Talk to all the shop owners for scenes. (Tiffani first.) You can now use
       Wholesale. USE IT AND ABUSE IT. Don't be picky, if someone asks for it
       in a request and/or you find it obnoxious to make, wholesale!

     - All you have to do is register an item. Each shopkeep lets you register
       different kinds of items, so you may have to look around. Several days
       later, you can buy several copies of the item. Very handy for
       Assignments and requests.

     - If you don't get scenes, raise friendship to 30. This includes Pamela
       but not Cole, understandbly. Tiffani's event happens regardless of
       friendship, I hear.

     - Remember that Bomb I wanted you to make? Register it with Hagel.

     - No, Wholesale stuff does not carry over in New Game+. You don't need it
       anyway.

     - The shopkeeps can register more categories of items than the game lets
       on. So just "shop around" till you find a taker for your item.

 • With friends
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - If you're aiming for Tantris' ending, be sure to have gotten three big
       stars on the last assignment, then go adventuring with him for a scene.
       It wouldn't be a bad idea to take him along for the vultures, even if
       you don't use him in your party.

     - As for Iksel, after this point, if you make an amazing food item he'll
       drop by. After a few more scenes, you'll have a cooking battle. Do not
       skip this if you care about him at all. This may also conflict with a
       later Gio event, so beware.

 • Visit Rorona's home for 2 Audra's Tail, 1 Mermaid Tear, 2 Puniball.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • Cole again
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - He makes Ster Highlands availible to you, regardless of what you buy.

     - Pamela event will take precedence, so be very careful not to activate
       the event in which no one comes to her store till after this date.

     - When you go there, bring bombs. But you'll have to have decent equipment
       to even progress past the first area. And by "decent", I mean "possibly
       better than what you have now". At least the armor needs to be upgraded,
       as the wolves attack twice for a good chunk of HP.

       I suggest to make a set of accessories, and get as many Attach XXX
       traits as you can (for attacking). Possibly Convert Damage too. Armor
       created with Tanbeash and weapons created with Ster Metal are probably
       as good as it gets for now.

       Be sure to create all your equipment at once.

       Be level 20+, preferably with Sterk in your party, as his horizontal
       attacks are awesome through there.

     - The recipe you get there has Bunny Tail. Perfect for grinding. But it'll
       be a while before you can grind with it...

     - The sooner you get through Ster Highlands, the better. It just makes the
       game easier and more relaxed.

     - After entering Ster Highlands, your new grinding goal should be level
       30. You'll have trouble in Night's Domain and Orthogalaxen (the final
       two areas, unlocked in Year 3) if you don't get that high.

  Items: Bomb Ice or Spring Water.

    Due: 9/30

    How: They're both relatively easy to make, but also a pain. You could buy
         from Pamela, but that's expensive. I combined the two, personally. I
         found it easier to make a few good Spring Waters over a bunch of Bomb
         Ice when I had Hom make me the Ingots necessary. Or you could buy
         Ingots from Hagel.

 • Recipes
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Hermes Collection (Nabel Lake)
     - Alchemy Pie (80 quality pies)

     - You apparently need Cory around to get the Piemeteor scene, and if you
       don't see it, then you'll have problems getting the final pies. This is
       a very possible issue by the time you get to make it, because Cory will
       leave temporarily as part of her events.

 • Nabel Lake opens up to you
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Just a little tip about this area. Go once for the recipe and the Swirly
       Shell (Iksel required). Bring a couple Bomb Ice for good measure. But
       you need Air Drops to get real value out of this area, and Pamela won't
       sell the recipe yet.

     - For the event at Nabel, Cordelia must have friendship over 30, Lionela
       over 20, and Pamela must have opened her shop by now.

 • Go to Rorona's home for 2 Night Lady, 3 Uni, 2 Beehive at some point after
   this day.

 • With Friends
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - For those of you following Tantris' end, go adventuring with him for
       an optional scene.

     - Come back to the Workshop after this day with a full basket to get a
       larger one (100 items!) from Cole. 10 friendship required.

     - Be sure to fail a synthesis for Cordelia's end. Also, don't do the fifth
       trust lowering request till Year 3, 1/1 and beyond if you're interested
       in the Pie and Rich ends.

   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
      - You get Foamy Water and the trophy To the Lake. Astrid is pretty
        awesome. XD

      - This hogs 10 days. You have missed Cole.

 • Hom Event
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - It will follow sometime after this. You have to synth something to
       trigger it.

     - On another date later on, you can synth something again for another
       scene and a trophy, Hom and Kitten.

     - I don't think you can miss this, or the other events associated with it.

   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Dark Woods is availble to you. You may need 30 friendship. Iksy is a
       jerk. :D

     - I recommend using the Dark Woods or Ster Highlands as a grinding spot to
       get to Adventurer Level 25+. This will open up a dungeon later. But you
       have till 3/3 to do it. Later, Lost City will be a good griding place as
       well, despite how short it is.

    Due: 12/20

    How: I don't think I should tell you how to do something twice. You have
         better ingredients -- and Hom -- so use them. Barrels are easier.
         Just make a really good Barrel and register with Tiffani.

 • Recipes
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Book of Lawe (Pamela)
     - Necronimicon (Lost City)

     - Make that Secret Bag DO IT DO IT DO IT. Then you can have a ton of
       Bombs/Healing Items/Miscellanea in your basket and not worry about it
       because you have a free ticket to transfering items to the Container.
       From anywhere!

     - With the new recipe from Pamela, go to Nabel Lake of Nabel Lake, then
       use an air drop to get underwater. Follow the path to get to Lost City.
       Bring a ton of air drops though. And the enemies give a good deal of
       EXP.

     - Most importantly, you get to make Windrider. Never walk back to the
       workshop again! Make it ASAP and register it to Pamela.

     - Eventually, the dragon Helstrom will pop up down there. Keep it in mind.
       Seems to be triggered by Sterk's events though.

     - Since I'm on the subject, strong monsters will appear in areas you
       already visited. The description of each area will tell you the types of
       enemies there, including "super dangerous" ones.

 • Drop by Rorona's home sometime for two of the following: Marinelite,
   Sea Puddle, Salt.

 • Tera Bomb Time
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Be sure to have the recipe from Ster Highlands.

     - Also, you want to drop by Dark Woods or send Hom. I don't know why, but
       stuff there tends to have +3 stuff you want.

     - You want to create a Tera Bomb with as many of the following traits as
       possible:

           Boost Effect +3
           Narrow Range +3
           Restrain Range     (Made with Narrow Range +3 and Stable +3)
           Boost Quality +3   (Made with Quality +3 and Boost Effect +3)
           Satisfying +3

           Your Supplements should handle most of these traits, preferably all.
           You may have to make 7 at once.

       Or you can come as close as possible. This is overkill. ;) Narrow Range
       +3 is the bare minimum, and it's critically important. The bomb will
       blow up in your face otherwise.

     - You need the effect effect Explosion Damage. Fire Damage+ is crap.
       However, don't fret if all you get is Fire Damage+. Even though it's
       crap, it will suffice if you get enough of those traits. For general
       use, not for what I'm plotting.

     - Also, make a bunch of other bombs like that, just for kicks. You want
       them to be mass produced for epic pwnage.

       Hell, if you can't make the perfect Tera Bomb, make the best Bomb Ice
       you can. Trust me. Water Damage L or bust though.

   also hire Gio, finally. This claims several days. You miss Cole.

   If you aren't at the workshop on this day, Gio will come to get you later.

   This may conflict with the Cooking Battle. Be careful.

 • Travel somewhere, ANYWHERE, with Gio so that you can unlock his events.

 • Evaluation.

 • Martial Contest
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Esty is really evil this time.

       Easiest way to win is bombs and such. So be sure to have some good ones
       before today. :) For the Sterk battle, you want anything but Wind Damage
       L on your bomb of choice.

       The HP values are about 150, 300, and 700. And Sterk is hard hitting.
       You need decent armor to survive even one hit.

       You get a Sun Cloak (lulz, I had one equipped on Rorona) for winning,
       along with the trophy Martial Master.

     - If your relationship with Gio is over 50 (as it should be if you want
       his end) then you fight him. You do not have to win. Remember that Tera
       Bomb?

       That's about the only thing that'll blow him away. If you have two Bomb
       Ice, Quality 100 (more is better!) with the same traits as that Tera
       Bomb I wanted you to make, you CAN get lucky and kill the bastard. He
       has about 2000 HP.

       You get rewarded with... well, a different scene. IT FEELS GOOD, DAMMIT.
       Gio is the most difficult enemy to beat in the game. By far.

     - For Gio's end, you don't need to see this battle. I suggest you do,
       however! :)

  Items: Komet and Arland Crystal. Depends on type and effect.

    Due: 3/30

    How: Make the least obnoxious of the two and register it to someone. If you
         don't like that (expensive) method... try making the least obnoxious
         one. As always. If you don't have Pamela, then you have to spam Arland
         Crystals. At least they're easy.

 • To Rorona's house for 3 Uni, a Beast Skin, and 2 Forgotten Bones.

 • About endings
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - For the sake of all endings, this is a good point to make a backup save,
       as many events will happen after this point. You should be making
       jillions of saves in the future too.

       It's not necessary, just a precaution. You have no idea how many times
       having a backup save here has saved me.

     - It's a good idea to make this save for the sake of the rich end too. You
       are not allowed to finish the events of any character for that end, and
       it is impossible to do so before this point. 

     - Pie and Rich go wonderfully together because Pies get you lots of money.
       Use Tantris or Lionela to control which end you get. (Pie requires at
       least one person's events to be finished.)

 • With Friends
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - If you're following Tantris' end, then another event can be triggered
       here. Another will follow a week later.

     - Once you get Cole's friendship high enough, you'll get a scene about
       medicine. For the record, Cole's events aren't important anymore.

     - If Gio's friendship is over 70, you'll get a scene with Sterk at the
       Sundries store. If not, be careful to not finish Sterk's events before
       Gio's. In any case, after triggering this, the rest of his events are
       automatic.

     - You should be able to get the fifth trust lowering request now. If
       you've done them all up to this point, you'll get a scene upon
       completion. Then a sighing event will follow. Then talk to Esty. Then
       leave the workshop later for another scene. Then wait 10 days for the
       final one. Then then then. :P

 • If Sterk's friendship is over 60, he'll warn you about a Dragon. Face it
   before 7/1 if you care for his ending. You don't have to win the first time,
   but you do have to have over 80 days left.

   Oh, and unlock Orthogalaxen first. You do NOT want to wait for it.

 • You can also fight Dragon enemies after seeing this event, not just Suni.
   You'll get the trophy Dragonbane for beating one of them.

   for a scene.

   off if you're aiming for multiple ends.

   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Orthogalaxen is now open! Great grinding place. :) But strong enemies. I
       say be at level 30-ish before entering.

     - Once you are high enough in level, there is a Dragon enemy down there.
       Two, in fact. Hint: Bomb Ice. For both Dragons.

     - At the end is the Iron Giant, a very strong monster required for the
       Adventurer End. Don't tackle it till you're level 45+. Unless you have
       crazy awesome bombs.

       Iron Giant is easier to kill than the other super strong monster, which
       I will mention later. For these bosses, bring the best bombs and globes
       in addition to Healing Bells and Nectars/Elixirs.

       As for the bombs, bring a bunch and build up the element level to 5. The
       bombs will dish out more damage. Try to not conflict with your party
       members.

       He drops gold and gives you the Destroyer trophy.

 • Money Grinding!
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - For the Millionaire ending, you WANT to go to Orthogalaxen and/or send
       Hom. Pie too! And Adventurer.

     - There are materials that you can use to create Halmolium Ingots, which
       you can easily get rid of for loads of Cole for Front Quests. Velvetis
       Cloths, which come from the Dragon Scales, are also worth a ton. I
       believe Hom started collecting the materials necessary at level 45. But
       eventually, I had a ton to work with. They sell for a decent amount in
       stores, and Esty may ask for them.

     - You also get the Ruby and Gold recipes way up there (one of the final
       floors). Make the Ruby Pie, register it with Iksel, and bring to Esty
       for loads of cash.

     - OR you could get some Victory Charms, go to Floor 9, and get loads of
       Dunkelheiten for lots of monies from Esty. Floor 2 works as well.

     - Or you can go to Floor 8, obliterate the enemies there, and sell the
       equipment.

     - Or or or you could sell the Isle Amber from the Tiger Fish on Floor 11.

  Items: Gather Shadow Grass, Dark Coral, Midnight Flower.

    Due: 6/30

    How: You may want bombs and such. In the Black Bird Nest area (second area)
         head right after the bridge. Go through the area it leads to, then the
         next. You'll run into a Griffon type enemy. It guards Shadow Grass.

         Back to Black Bird Nest. This time, go left after the bridge. In the
         new area, head north after the bridge. Here, you can find Dark Coral.
         Dark Coral is the easiest to get.

         Follow the path to the next area, head south through the path the
         Griffon enemy is guarding and into the next area. You get Midnight
         Flowers here.

         I suggest doing poorly on this assignment. The materials are nice.

   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - Following the extra paths will take you to a dragon. Bring some very
       powerful items to beat it. You'll get the recipe Bandit Legacy.

     - Make some Victory Charms if you haven't. Dark Dew is a rare drop you can
       get there. And the charms are useful in Orthogalaxen, obviously.

     - For the Adventurer End and Demon Hunter trophy, you must go to the end
       and face Demon. Like the Iron Giant, you want either a handful of great
       bombs and healing bells, or an uber Tera Bomb to one-shot him with.

 • Grinding!
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - If you dropped Cory a long time ago and you want to grind with her, now
       is the time to make a Bunny Tail. Use ingredients from Night's Domain to

       Orthogalaxen and grind grind grind!

       Remember, having her at level 50 is important for the Adventurer end.

 • More Money Grinding!
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     - This is a very boring, very easy way to get a million cole.

     - Register a 120 quality Spring Cup with the effect Good Spring Liquid to
       Pamela. To speed up the process, let her mass produce them and fill all
       of her store's slots with these cups. You can buy the items you
       previously had registered and re-register them when you're done.

     - Acquire at least one Dark Dew.

     - Start using your Spring Cups like crazy. You should get a couple Dark
       Dews per usage. If you filled up all of Pamela's slots with Spring Cups,
       you can get a a third of a million in a day.

     - Sell sell sell!

 • To Rorona's home for a Globe Sphere, 3 Uni, and 2 Mandra Roots.

 • Another Tantris event can be triggered here with 80 friendship. After that,
   simply speak to him and he'll ask you to make an item.

   Remember, if you want multiple ends, hold off on finishing his events.

  Items: [Sundry] items.

    Due: 9/30

    How: Why don't they just give the stars away? Make whatever you want.
         Register it to Tiffani, if you want, and spam. <3 Even Supplements
         work. If you can't make amazing Supplements by now, there's no hope
         for you. I had a few things registered to Tiffani, so this was very
         easy for me.

  Stars: 8

 • Recipe

     - Ultimate Pie (80 Quality pies, and there was a chance you could've
       gotten this recipe before)

 • To Rorona's home for a Globe Sphere, 3 Uni, and a Dunkelheit.

     - It may be impossible to get below 80 trust if you have 100 trust at the
       beginning of the next assignment. Or you'll be cutting it close. So if
       you want the Normal/Bad ends, you should start soon.

     - Make a backup save, and make it NOW. The ending star requirements are
       not totally understood. Once, 91 stars got me the normal end. For
       others, it gave them the bad end. I've designed my recommended star
       values around both the values of 87 and 94 to hopefully prevent
       problems.

       However, a save here will prevent the lack of definite numbers from
       screwing you over.

                            |    Assignment 12    |
                             `-----. WLK12 .-----´
                                    `-----´

  Items: Anything and everything. Item level is taken into account.

    Due: 12/30

    How: This time, you don't have to spam. Make it right once, dammit, and
         you're done. So make something hard, make it rare, and make it good.

         Elixir is a good choice. I managed to make one with 120 quality and
         awesome effects. The stuff in Orthogalaxen will help you make a good
         one (specifically the Dragon Tusks). I also had a good 120 quality
         Nectar to put into it. Get the best effect you can into your Nectar.

         For less stars, something like a bomb will do. You probably have
         something sitting around that will fit your needs.

  Stars: Whatever floats your chosen ending's boat. If you followed my values,
         you should have 84. 3 stars and you'll get a good/bad end. More and
         you may get the Normal/True. Get all 10 stars for a guarantee.

         There is a reason for this. The "usual" value of 94 stars for the
         Normal/True ends is not always correct. I have verified this myself.
         I've gotten those ends with as little as 89 stars.

 • Talk to anyone who has a friendship of over 80.

 • To Rorona's house for a Dragon Tusk, Dragon Scale, and Dark Dew.

 • For multiple ends, you want to create a backup save here. For characters,
   you have to either fail or give up (sometimes giving up doesn't work, so
   beware!) a request to influence the end.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 • You'll be able to harvest Dunkelheiten (proper German!) at Dark Woods,
   Miracle Forest. Why today? Hell if I know. There are better ways to get it
   than to go there, however. Victory Charms! Orthogalaxen!

 • Sell everything. You need the money, because it carries over. Items do not.
   Encyclopedia entries do. Where's my select all feature ._.

   You'd be surprised at how much your items are worth. Really.

   None of this matters if you already have 1 million cole though.

 • Talk to everyone. Yay it's over. Now play again. ;P

 • The "night before" scene is a big indicator as to what end you'll get. You
   may see no one at all.

This is in the order that you will find in your Encyclopedia. Not all items
(especially pies) are listed. There will be a blank in that spot, because I
know how much is missing.

If you see an asterisk (*) next to an ingredient, that ingredient determines
the effect. I haven't gotten all effects, nor have I gotten around to putting
asterisks next to everything.

I have not included category numbers. It's for my sanity, and you really don't
need them.

Complete         ...


12 Assignment    You know this very well, just do the Assignments.
Trophies


Rorona's         Automatic, early game.
Workshop


The Puppet       You get it upon seeing Lionela. Year 1, 9/7
Show Begins


The Wandering    Tantris event. Go anywhere but the Catacombs on Year 2, 1/1.
Bard


The Ghost &      Find Pamela in the Catacombs after Year 2, 1/2. And do rush
Teddy Bear       back, as it's important for her to open up a shop.


Making Up        Finish Cordelia's events. See Character Events.


Honorable        Defeat the dragon as part of Sterk's events. See Character
Injury           Events.

                 times. See Character Events.


Puppets          Finish Lionela's events. See Character Events.
and a Girl


Duet             Finish Tantris' events. See Character Events.

Hom and Kitten   After Year 2, 7/8, synth something. A Hom event will follow.
                 Synthing more will bring more events, which eventually get you
                 this trophy. I don't think you can miss it.


Drunken Tiffani  Get Tiffani's friendship up to 60 and to to Sunrise Cafe.


To the Lake      Open Pamela's shop, have Cordelia's friendship over 30 and
                 Lionela's over 20 by Year 2, 7/1.


14 Ending        See ending section and Character Events. And be careful.
Trophies


Game Over        Fail any but the first assignment, because you can't fail it.


Monster          Find all monsters. Requires you to do Sterk's events, tons of
Complete         bounties, and some backtracking to find strong monsters.

                 I got the trophy upon opening the extras menu. You can do this
                 over several playthroughs.


Item Complete    Synth and collect everything. Includes equipment. You can do
                 this over several playthroughs, just make sure to save your
                 clear data at the end of each one. Key items don't count.

                 You may need to do Hagel's events to get the Helmet, not
                 necessarily the Wig.

                 If you're having trouble, consider what you got from Esty.
                 Make, buy, or synth anything you bought from her.

                 You'll get a scene upon completion. Well, it'll come late in
                 the game, sometime in Year 3. Don't remember the specific
                 date. Astrid will display her lack of musical talent and break
                 the fourth wall by giving you the Trophy.


Adventurer       Self explanatory. I suggest doing this with the Adventurer
Lv. 50           end, mainly because it's required. You can use Bunny Tails
                 made with materials from Night's Domain to help you grind.


Alchemy Lv. 50   Also self explanatory. Do this with the Pie end. Be daring.
                 Make a save and synth something way above your level (easy to
                 do with high level pies). If you fail, reload and try again.
                 You'll get more EXP if you synth above your level.

                 The experience you gain will happen regardless, but you want
                 the damn item so that you don't waste ingredients.


Hom Lv. 50       Just keep Hom exploring all the time and it'll be done quick.
                 It's easier to just keep Hom busy that way than to constantly
                 be picking out stuff to synth. And you'll get nice ingredients
                 at high levels.


Trust 100        Do this with a Good or True end. It's pretty simple.


NPC Friendship   Easiest to do on a Normal end, but not a bad idea to do on
100              any end.


The Cabbage      Choose to watch the events at the end of the first year and
Girl             collect 40 cabbages to win the event. Very easy.


Martial Master   Watch the events at the end of the second year, but bring a
                 damn good bomb or two to win the fights. Only required to win
                 up to Sterk, which is very possible with even a mediocre Bomb
                 Ice. Gio battle is optional to see, optional to win.


Dragonbane       Kill a dragon. Any dragon. Requires the Suni Sterm event to be
                 activated, though you don't have to go all the way through
                 with Sterk's events after he mentions it.


Demon Hunter     Kill the Demon at Night's Domain. Bombs, dammit. Skills are
                 worthless in this fight, as they cost way more than usual.


Destroyer        Kill the Iron Giant. Also bombs. I discuss strategy in many
                 different places, and it boils down to the *same* strategy.
                 Tera Bombs, Explosion Damage, Narrow Range +3. Level 45+.

This is a section devoted mostly to completionists who want to minimize
playthroughs.

You can do everything in one playthrough, but you have to be time efficient
from the very start. If you don't feel like doing that, stretch it out to two.

I'm not going to baby you. Make a bunch of save slots, and I'll tell you where
the major ones should be.


                        .----------------------------.
                       |    Two Playthrough Method    |
                        `----------------------------´

AKA, less stressful method. Basically, put most of the work in the first
playthrough and relax a bit for the second.


Choose an end or a set of ends
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It's not the easiest of ends to get, but I recommend Adventurer. If you can't
manage that, Normal or the other True ends will do.

I suggest dropping Cory from your party for Sterk early on. You can get around
this by grinding with Cory in Orthogalaxen Floor 1 with a Bunny Tail, made with
ingredients from Night's Domain. Remember, you have to have her level up to 50,
and Iron Giant and Demon must be dead.

Most ends will do, just don't choose Rich unless you're ready for extreme money
grinding.


Grab some trophies
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The best favor you can do for yourself in this playthrough is NPC Friendship
100. Lots of trophies will come automatically, or near automatically,
otherwise. But you may want to get Trust 100 out of the way as well. 

You should get both Festival trophies (Cabbage Girl and Martial Master), though
if you miss Martial Master for whatever reason, you have another playthrough to
get it.

Definitely get To The Lake as well.

Hom Level 50 is very easy, so long as you constantly keep Hom gathering. Hom
and Kitten is similarly easy, and I'm not sure if you can miss it.

The last easy trophy is Game Over. You can get this with any assignment except
for the first. So just... sleep your way through an assignment.

As for the ends, with Adventurer comes the obvious ending trophy, Adventurer
Level 50, Destroyer, Demon Hunter, and a good chunk taken out of Monster
Complete. These are all good reasons to focus on it early.


Synth like crazy
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Synth as many items as you can, and make a lot of equipment. It will make your
life easier when you're scrambling to get Item Complete later on.

You can dismantle equipment to get your ingot/cloth back, but you may get a
different Effect. So be careful when using the same material to make lots of
equipment!


Unlock Bounties
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Whether you're doing the Adventurer end or not, unlock Bounties from Esty ASAP.
The monsters are a pain in the ass because they don't show up often.

On a related note, it's a good idea to kill as many Strong enemies as possible.
This requires your level to be high enough to face them... which means
backtracking is necessary.

Dragons aren't a half bad idea, but you'll need to unlock the Suni Sterm event
with Sterk first.


Money!
¯¯¯¯¯¯
And whatever you do, money grind in Orthogalaxen. You will have time to do
this, possibly even enough to get the Millionaire end.

You need Victory Charms, Esty, and a lot of Windriders. The second floor has
enemies with Dunkelheit as a drop. Kill 'em, take to Esty.

Floor 8 has Bodyguards that drop equipment. Sell for a good chunk of money.

Floor 11 has Tiger Fish that drop Isle Amber. Sell or take to Esty.

At the end of the game, sell everything you have.

Alternatively, you can use Spring Cups to money grind. Register 10 to Pamela,
with the best effect and quality, then sell all the Dark Dews you can. This
takes minimal in-game time, even if it's really boring.

This also requires you to have had at least one Dark Dew.


Second Playthrough
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You'll have to focus on getting any trophies you don't already have. These
should be primarily character and end focused, though you probably have Item
Complete and Monster Complete to worry about.

At Year 3, 1/1, make a split save. Do as many character events as possible till
then.


Split A
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Do not do any character events except for Tantris OR Lionela (and don't finish
them till I say you can). Do not trigger the Normal End. Pie/Rich is the focus
of this split. This is probably a good time to get Trust 100.

You have to go into Orthogalaxen for the Ruby and Gold recipe. Make the Ruby
Pie and register it with Iksy. Take it to Esty daily once she asks for it.

Combine this with the typical money grinding methods I already described till
you hit 1,000,000. That is, go to your favorite floor in Orthogalaxen, money
grind, and use a Windrider to get the hell outta there without wasting time.

Get your Alchemy Level to 50, and make all pies. In fact, synth EVERYTHING you
haven't already. Astrid will hand you the Item Complete trophy.

Creat a new split save during Assignment 12.

After you hit 1,000,000, rush to the end without finishing any character's
events for the Rich end.

Then, go back to your new split and finish off Tantris/Lionela's events. You
will get the Pie end.


Split B
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
If you didn't do Adventurer end, you'll probably want to make another split
save when Orthogalaxen opens and rush Cory to level 50.

Otherwise, keep your Trust at 80-ish, and make a backup save at Year 3, 7/1 to
make ABSOLUTELY sure you get the ends you want (remember, star issues). Tie up
what loose ends remain, but you should mostly be going for the end.

REMEMBER, don't trigger Astrid's end till you want it. So don't do Tantris AND
Lionela's final event till you're ready for Astrid. Do one or the other to
manipulate the end. Not both.


                        .----------------------------.
                       |    One Playthrough Method    |
                        `----------------------------´

AKA Masochism Mode... Just kidding. A lot of the advice from the other method
applies here, but you have to do things faster in this one.


Trust and Friendship
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Devote your SOUL to getting both of these up. Friends need to be up to 100,
including NPCs. Don't be afraid of buying things to fulfill requests early on.

Requests change every 4 days. So stalk your friends that often.

Get your Trust up to 80 and let it hang. On one save (made at Year 3, 1/1 for
most ends) keep it around there. On the other (for the Rich/Pie ends) get it
up to 100.


Efficiency!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Maximize your dungeon runs. Return as little as possible. Go straight to the
recipes. You'll need to return for bounties, however.


Level, Dammit
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
DO NOT IGNORE BATTLES. EVER. UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. You want to get through
Ster Highlands as soon as you can, and as fast as you can. The game becomes a
breeze if you do it. This also means being smart with your equipment.


Windrider
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
When you get Air Drops, go straight to Area 5 of Nabel Lake (I believe it's
called Nabel Lake), go underwater, and follow the path to Lost City. Keep going
through the new area to get the recipe for Windrider. Return, synth one, and
register it. Never leave town without one ever again. Never money grind or
level grind without one.


Watch out for Sterk!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Don't finish his events till you've finished Gio's events. And after you unlock
Orthogalaxen.


Year 3 Split Save
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Just like the one from the Two Playthrough Method. However, you have to more
frantically money grind, AND you have to be extra careful about bounty
monsters.

                                `------------´

These two appear regardless of level when you approach the end of their areas.
They will likely kick your ass if you are not level 45 or so with the best
equipment you can find. I have listed their HP values for your convenience.

The best way to beat these two is to chuck bombs, especially Tera Bombs with
Explosion Damage (and Narrow Range +3 as a trait!!!). However, spamming most
elemental bombs will work, so long as you have XXX Damage L effects.

rorona.gkwiki.com    For dates to watch out for, ending info and some general
                     information.


Google Translate     For translating the above wiki to Engrish. Yes, Engrish.


GFAQs boards         General advice and information. And, dammit, quit making
                     topics. Every time you all make a topic, I change this
                     guide. D:

                     Nah, just kidding. About the quitting part, that is.


FreeBardWren         For the quality equation.


ASCGEN.net           For the ASCII at the top. Like hell I could've drawn that.


sou                  For translating the ending priorities.


Satoshi42            For info on the To the Lake trophy.


Procrastination      Without you, this guide wouldn't have been born.


Krystal109           For corrections, and for the dungeons idea... I decided to
                     do it after all. :P We've learned a lot from each other.
                     You'd be surprised.


Wraith Magus         For a neat money grinding trick, and reminding me of how
                     much I ignored the Happy Basket and Spring Cup items.


I do suggest going to the Krystal's guide if I missed something (shouldn't be
much, at this point, but this game has so many potential issues...). Yes, I'm
telling you to go the "the enemy" before writing an angry email.

You may write the angry email after you've gone there. :P
