The reality of email is that I don't respond to it often. I advise against
asking me questions, as chances are I'll see them a week later or so and I will
assume you either figured it out or moved on by that point.

Feel free to leave a note if you want me to respond no matter how late I get
to it. This does not guarantee response, but it makes it MUCH more likely.

  Longtime AT fan here. Figured if I was going to write another guide, it might
  as well go for a series I like.

  It certainly helps that I can play this during the daytime shamelessly, as
  the parents have long ago quit caring what I play. They roll their eyes and
  walk the other way. It's not my fault few games cater to women. But then
  again, I'd probably laugh my ass off at an otome game. (Update: Played
  Hakuoki. Didn't laugh ass off. However, I watched Uta no Prince-sama which is
  based off an otome game and laughed away at how bad it was.)

  OOOH, BISHIE SPARKLES! *`*.*`*


  A few notes about this guide.

    1. I'm not going to focus on gameplay. Don't expect elaborate boss
       strategies. It's hard to do, given that the gameplay itself is so basic.
       Besides, if you go on hard, you did it to yourself and I assume you know
       what you're doing. :P

    2. This guide is focused upon Talk Topics, endings, trophies, etc. The
       things that make Ar tonelico worthwhile. And maybe directions through
       the Clustanian District.

    3. Pay close attention. I don't like complaints because you didn't see a
       sentence or two. However, if the error is mine, feel free to complain.

       Besides, I do my damned best to make imporant stuff obvious.

  Take off your clothes to save the world!


  Lastly, mega thanks to Gust Wiki for helping me get all the talk topics I
  missed on my first run... which was a decent amount ~_~

      Square = Attack
    Triangle = Battle Menu
      Circle = Blow
           X = Unleash Song Magic
  Don't move = Defend


Heroine Field
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Your reyvateil's personal space bubble. Don't let the enemy get too close,
  otherwise they can't unleash song magic or increase burst. Use a Blow to get
  rid of them. Blows, by the way, recharge over time.

  Also, stand inside the field for some recovery. Hyumas are better for it.


Purge
¯¯¯¯¯
  Hold a shoulder button and shake. You can Purge multiple times at once by
  holding more buttons, but don't do this till they're... agreeable. Get
  several beat ups before trying.. Otherwise they'll get angry and unleash
  their song magic instead.

  Purge on a red beat to get the stripping movie. You attack on red beats, by
  the way, to make them want to purge (you'll know it by "Beat up").

  Every once in a while, there is also scramble, which instantly lets them
  purge. It can be stuff like taking a lot of damage; anything "surprising".

  The last purge is flipsphere It's basically the strongest move you got. You
  have to hit X to the beat of the music. The better you do, the more hits you
  get. The more hits you get, the greater the damage. Wait till you hit the
  millions :D

  You cannot purge when the enemy is in the personal space bubble or charging
  an attack. Or if an enemy uses a purge blocking move.


Hyuma
¯¯¯¯¯
  These gals change the battle music under various conditions. They also
  provide benefits to the vanguards, so you should use 'em for that.

  At save points, you can equip hyuma through song synthesis. For higher level
  hyuma, you may have to give the girl a gift to get her to strip. Try key
  items from Migrating Birds stores. 


Supermoves
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Gradually you will be allowed to synth these for your vanguards. You use them
  by hitting square and a directional button... at the cost of some HP.

  These are VERY HANDY for purging faster. Use them on the red beats and watch
  how fast they toss off their clothes!

  As for your ultra supermoves (with the anime and whatnot), you need 30,000%
  burst and you can access it from the menu.

  Even if you intend to have a full playthrough on hard, I do not suggest
  starting that way. Boss one will kill you in two hits. Boss one also happens
  to be the tutorial fight.

  Good ruck enjoying EXEC_CUTYPUMP/. :P Yes, "ruck", and you'll hear it in the
  lyrics. Do you see Mute's panties? I do.

  Oh, right, walkthrough. ;) This guide does feature some trivia and commentary
  occasionally.

  You can save in the building to the left. In any case, you'll be forced to go
  right to meet Tatsumi and some Clustanian Soldiers that you'll fight. Saki
  will join the second battle. Go ahead and rest at the save point for a scene.

  Rest again to be introduced to Talk Topics. Henceforth, I will list all
  availible Talk Topics, by character or party, at the top of a section. You do
  not need to catch 'em all for Platinum.

  Note that encounters are random, but limited. In any case, head west to the
  ladder, then down the next. You'll come to two ladders; the one leading up is
  attached to a scene. Climb up it and the next one, then go to the higher part
  and jump all the way down from there to get to a [Kiai Belt]. Take the
  downward ladder to [Rescue Injection] (which will trigger a Talk Topic for
  Saki), then all the way up.

    1. When you have a talk topic related to items, such as Rescue Injection
       and Big Ribbon, you MUST have them in your INVENTORY. Equipping takes
       the item out, and the talk topic temporarily vanishes. 

    2. On your second playthrough, forget the idea of doing gameplay-related
       Talk Topics for a while. You'll kill too quickly.

    3. Speaking of limited encounters, you need to clear that bar at the
       bottom 25 times in a playthrough for a trophy. You also have to run
       100 times and win 300 battles.

    4. If you're extra worried about chests, use this:

  There's a bridge and a ladder. The bridge leads to a [Crab Claw Sword]. Head
  across the upper bridge and climb all the way up for [Bronze Material]. Now
  go for the stairs to a save point. Scene up the ladder.

  Once you regain control, battle! It's immune to physical attacks, so it's
  time to be introduced to Purge. Do not hold down all the shoulder buttons;
  each button represents one level of purging. If you hold them all down, what
  you're doing is trying to purge FOUR TIMES. You haven't unlocked that ability
  yet, so your girl will get pissed and unleash her song magic instead.

  In any case, run through the path available for... another scene. That's an
  awful strange place for a damsel in distress. Up the ladder to save her.
  Fil--, uh, Finnel joins the party. ;) Switch to her and fight with her for a
  Talk Topic. Head south down the stairs, then east for a [Bronze Material].
  Drop down the cliff for [Weakness Detector] and [Tsurugi 07].

  Down the ladder for a [Big Ribbon], which unlocks a talk topic for Finnel.
  Down the set of stairs now for a fork. East for a [Bitter Capsule] and
  [Bronze Material]. West leads out.

  To Reverse Lamp Bazaar with ya, then to Waterforest. Pick up the Talk Topic
  (shiny!), then head to the bistro (the southern door). Hikari Gojo will force
  you into making medicine, so time for the synthesis tutorial and the recipe
  for Spunky V. Or maybe Chintzy Powerfill.

  You're forced back to the Bistro, then the Inn, then the Dive Shop. lol. BTW,
  I went back to Blue Heaven Trail to get a couple gameplay-related Talk
  Topics. Fight with Finnel a bit and let her take a hit. You may have to, if
  you answer incorrectly (-99999 DP, lol). You'll continue after clearing CS1,
  or maybe after getting the Hyuma. I'm not sure... XD

  Anyway, I have a section devoted to the CS. There are missables in there, so
  check it out.

    1. In the item section, I always use Aoto's name for stuff. Also, synth
       60 items for a series of trophies.

    2. Hit select while diving. 100 times. Trophy! And be sure to read the
       BBQ Soda recipe at some point :)

    3. While my CS section labels some things as "optional", completionists,
       they're quite often mandatory. Optional means "not required to get a
       paradigm shift".

    4. For 100% completion in the CS, you have to do it IN ONE PLAYTHROUGH.
       Do not even THINK about the Extras menu. You would do well, then, to
       do everything possible in the CS for both girls leading up to Phase 2.

  You also get your first Party Topic. Woot. Afterward, head to the Bistro and
  get the "Mascot Girl?" topic. Buy a Yokkora Set for a Finnel Talk Topic.
  Also, be sure Aoto's default weapon is in your inventory for another.

  Boss fight coming up!

  Mute versus Gengai. You know who you're fighting! I know how it looks now,
  but Mute is actually quite a good character.

  Southwest of where you start is a save point and a [Rare Metal], and up the
  ladder is [?Fan?]. Cross the bridge for a scene, then down all the ladders
  for [?Dice?]. Climb all the way up for [B-Good Beta]. Continue to the stairs
  and ladder to the east. You'll run by [?Shiny Heavy Armor?] and
  [?Whistle Missile?].

  You'll eventually hit a scene.

  Please note, there a couple things under a strict time limit here. It isn't a
  good idea to wait. I don't know how long you have, and, honestly, I'm not
  interested in finding out.

  Since you're by the World Map exit, head to the home in Blue Heaven Trail for
  "About Soma". Might as well head to Eternus Shaft now. Pick up "I Hate
  Hospitals" in the Clinic, then go talk to the Weapon Shop guy near the clinic
  for "Weapon Shop Gramps", and finally go to the inn and talk to the old man
  for "In My Hometown"... which itself is attached to Finnel's "Sleeping At
  Your Home".

  Might as well Dive into Saki for the rest of the Talk Topics. Also, take her
  into battle several times and let her get hit for the two gameplay related
  topics. Be sure to save three Talk Topics up from Saki, then use 'em up
  consecutively for Finnel's "I Want to Talk More 1".

    1. I will never encourage you to dive except for rare occasions... but
       you can clear Finnel's CS2 to CS5 without the appropriate amount of
       talk topics. Keep that in mind. Wait till you have Teppo to try!

    2. Further, to have the number of talk topics necessary to trigger "we've
       talked a lot" topics will depend on you diving to have the number of
       topics necessary.

    3. Also, whenever you unlock a body, always fight several battles with it
       for talk topics.

  By the way, be sure to get some revival/healing items if you're low (I doubt
  you are, but the next battle will take some of them).

  Back to the Stairway, and yes, you'll be at the beginning. Back by the save
  point and up the stairs, then down the ladder for [Snake Eyes Plate]. The
  next ladder leads to [?Semi-Pro V-Board?]. The ladder after that has
  [Rare Metal]. [?Fancy Scarf?] is at the very top.

  Onward to Fallen Heaven Peak! But you get caught up in a fight. Prepare to
  use items, and a lot of 'em! Stupid AI...

  Keep following the path for friendlier people. Go down the ladder by the save
  point for "It's Saki's Fault". Rest for some hilarity and V-Style: Spring
  Issue.

    V-Style is a special series of items that allows you to synth Supermoves.
    The fifth is an... ultra supermove. Naming sense aside, Aoto gets Videos
    and Gojo gets Anatomy books... though they have a couple items that break
    the naming scheme.

    You really don't need them to beat the game, but they will make purging
    easier if you do them on red beats. And there's a trophy to get, which I
    will mention later.

  To Dr. Gojo's clinic, then search the areas in Waterforest. Be sure to stay
  at the inn so that you cannot miss the 2-2 topic for Saki. You'll be able to
  see it later should you not, but I wouldn't wait.

  Nugget for you: Finnel says her birth month is Ar Ciel. In Japanese, it's
  clearly Soutentei. Both Suzunomia and Soutentei are considered gods.
  Furthermore, the kanji for Soutentei mean "Blue Heaven Emperor". Datenkou,
  another god, means "Fallen Heaven Empress". Yep, the two peaks of the Great
  Fang are named for them.

  You should know the way back to Blue Canyon Hamlet. You'll get a scene at the

  Go to Paper Scissors to pick up "About Kiraha". and head north to the home
  for a scene. In the morning... lol. Don't you know, Filly, first girl wins.
  You get a trophy.

  If you're having trouble seeing, turn the brightness on your TV up. There
  isn't an in-game option for this.

  You start by [Replica Horn] and a save point. Up the ladder for [Hot Video].
  Take the north ladder to a [Duel Bobble], then take the next to a
  [Protection Suit].

    You can't get back into a particular part of this dungeon (well, you can,
    but avoid making the trick necessary). Get everything up to the Emergency
    Patch, then drop down the cliff near it.
   _______________________________________________________________________
     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Back up the two ladders, then up the stairs to the west for [Human Anatomy].
  Up the ladder, claim your [Emergency Patch], then drop down the cliff. Follow
  the path to the ladder, claim the [B-Good Beta] to the south, and continue
  till you find an [Optic Shield]. Down the ladder and you'll get a scene.

  As for myself, by Yurisica's standards, I guess I'm not getting married.

  South to [Rare Metal], west to [B-Good Beta], north to another scene. You
  find Gengai. Continue to another scene. Outward!

  Before doing anything, head to Blue Heaven Trail and to the Monk's place
  (again) for "It Pains Me".

  You can also go back to Blue Canyon Hamlet for a scene and Spunky V x5, Iron
  Ore x10, Mandragora x10, Cool Video. I don't know how long you have to do
  this. In any case, go to Aoto's place for "Folks From Blue Canyon".

  Back in Eternus Shaft, go to the Clinic. Doc's not in, but you gotta look. To
  the Bistro, then back to Eternus Gallery.

  By the eastern path is a scene and fight. Continue through the doors to a
  save point. Gojo is to the south, but he comes attached to another fight.

  After getting the doctor, go back through the doors and south. When you see a
  ladder, head through the nearby door to a [Proliferation Diode]. Back to the
  ladder and up for [Quick Loader]. Down the next ladder for [?Medical Bag?].
  Down the stairs and south for [?Worker Armor?]. Out the way you came. The
  town menu now has Ciela Pathway.

  Just keep going till you hit a scene. Down the ladder, then down the left one
  for [?Electric Ball?], and finally down the right for [?Industrial Tool?].
  You'll hit a save point next to your destination.

  I have to say, I love the designs of Clustanian battleships.

  Once in the Ciela Gate Reservoir, keep running till you hit a scene.
  Before doing anything, head down the right ladder and up the next for
  [V-Style: Summer Issue], then go ahead and change the water level to get
  down the other ladder. Keep following to a fork.

  Head north, then down the ladder. After climbing a couple levels, you'll hit
  [Beast Anatomy], then a save point. Follow the series of ladders to the south
  (the area without water blocking it) to a [Guardian Suit] and [?Tablet?].
  Back to the save point. Turn the valve to the east to open the way north.
  Before exiting, claim your [Rad Video] and [?Hip Clothes?] to the east.

  While in town, buy Thick Flavor Udon on Clockwork St. for a Talk Topic and
  pick up "It's Glaring!" nearby.

  Head south from where you start to get [Anatomy of the Heart]. Climb up the
  ladder to get [?High-Tech Medkit?]. Inside the nearby door, take the east
  path and head out to a [?Dragon Mouth?]. Now take the west one to a
  [?Pro V-Board?] and continue outside. Up the ladder, get [?Hyper Work Tool?]
  to the west.

  Go east till you hit a ladder. Climb down for [?Magic Stick?]. Head inside
  for [?Rotary Fan?]. Back up the ladders, then down the next one. Inside, then
  in the elevator to a save point. Continue to be within the factory proper.

  Inside, you won't get far before you get a scene and fight. Head inside the
  door you end up by to get a [Speed Needle]. The middle leads to [R1 Solvent]
  and the third one has [Criticoil]. Now head to where Katene told you. Turn
  right at the fork and enter the first door for [Iron Material]. Enter the
  plain door to the east for [?Frozen Can?], then go down the hallway to the
  more decorated one and a couple fights.

  You found her. Approach the disc for "Do You Understand?", and create the
  ?Tablet? for a Talk Topic with Saki (you can get Songstones at Ciela
  Pathway). Once you're done yapping, take the lift up and follow along to
  [?Industrial Armor?]. Up the next lift and keep climbing to an
  [Insane Video].

  You'll be at three lifts. The right one leads to [?Fishy Oil?], the middle
  goes nowhere, and the left one takes you to [V-Style: Fall Issue], a save
  point, and the last lift.

  Fighting Mute yet again, and I enjoyed dishing 100,000 damage out for once.
  And Saki being... well, Saki. lol. Time for EXEC_EP=NOVA/. It's a kitty song.

    You would do well to clear both girls' CS3 to prepare to restart from
    Phase 2 in NG+. You don't have to, but it takes out a bit of work. CS4
    can also be cleared, but you have to LOVE DP grinding. I don't!
   _______________________________________________________________________
     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

  Right next to where you are is "I Didn't Know". Talk to a soldier on
  Clockwork St. for "About Akane". Next to the inn, pick up "Aoto's Hometown".
  Go to Aoto's Home in Blue Canyon Hamlet to pick up "A Boy's Room 1". If
  you've spoken with Saki a lot, you should get "My Recent Topic 1".

  Now go back to the Moebius Factory. This is a good opportuny to grind Saki's
  DP for diving. Head into the room where Saki was held for [Justine Ruin]. The
  shortcut out is to the east door, then south.

  After you're done with all of the above, go to Morocacca Port. Windstone!

    Pick a girl. Go through her CS, and hers alone. Ignore the other, maybe
    use her DP for synthesis. I'm basically telling you to commit to a
    particular girl's set of ends and worry about the other later.

    Can't decide for whatever reason? Do Finnel first. She's easier to
    complete and she's generally regarded as the more likable one.

  For Finnel's "Nightly Conversation 1" topic, you need to talk to her several
  consecutive times, possibly with CS3 cleared. So start savin' topics. Do them
  preferably after all Saki topics so that you can get a topic that appears in
  the next section.

  Go to Filon Cross Bridge Town and buy Thin Flavor Udon for a talk topic. Go
  to the Central Station for a scene. Now to the Pre-school... for a fight
  against Mute, which doubles as a Flipsphere tutorial.

  After going to the inn, it's time to explore town more. Might as well go to
  the new place, Nya Nya Ya to see a familar face... Sasha! You get Chart of
  God. For two talk topics, buy a Dokkoi Set from Sasha, and then a Rock
  Grinder from the weapon shop. Back to the Inn and talk to the soldier to get
  "About Taking Baths 1". Now to Nya Nya Ya to pick up "Who the Heck Is
  She!?". Next to the Dive Shop is "Extremely Unsettling".

  Try entering the Think Tank now. Rejected. Afterward, go back to the Think
  Tank and they'll boot you out again. Talk to one of the guards where you end
  up to get "It Pisses Me Off!".

  Now to the Pre-school and dungeon.

  If you spoke with Finnel 3 consecutive times, you get a Saki topic. If not,
  don't panic, as you should be able to do it later.

  Follow the path to a fork and head west, then north for [Gold Material].
  Continue west, then north again to find a ladder. Go north and enter the door
  for a [?Humidifier?], then back to the first fork.

  Keep going north and you'll come to a ladder and a fork. Go east to
  [?Drink In A Bucket?], then up the ladder. The door to the east has
  [?Prism Accessory?], and the door to the west contains [Platinum Material].

  Back down the ladder, then all the way west west to a new ladder. This room
  has [Burning Launcher], [Gold Material], [Headgear], and [MSPU]. Go outside
  and take the next room to the east for Saki. Go through the far east door and
  enter the first door you see there for [Heart Apron]. Continue through the
  last east door for [?Something Button?], [Spark Stick], and [?Magic Frill?].
  Out the way you came. Nothing is beyond the big door.

  Next to where you start is [Supermove Notebook]. You'll eventually come to a
  lift, which takes you to [Soul Charger], then go back down the lift and up
  the ladder. Grab the [R2 Solvent] before heading up the next lift.
  [?Drill Blade?] is above, as is a save point. Continue along for a scene.

  So you can award the first one, finally, to either of the girls. These points
  are quite relevant to the ending system.

  This is the short version:

  3 Heart points    Locked into Finnel or Saki ends, a couple exclusive
                    trophies to be had.

  2:1 ratio         Can get Finnel/Saki ends, but required for other character
                    ends. Diving required for a confession if you want
                    Saki/Finnel/Tyria. Or don't dive at all for the fourth end.

                    As a point of clarification, you can only get Finnel's
                    end if you have 2 heart points on her. Saki will then be
                    locked out. So, at some point, you will have to restart
                    from Phase 2.

  If you want the full story, check out the ending section... or wait till I
  explain more at the third heart point. By the way, I won't obscure the fourth
  girl's name for very long, and it's definitely not obscured in that section.

  Henceforth, you'll get Talk Topics unique to a particular path.

  The "exclusive trophies" are Saki Romantic Scene 2 and Good Mood With Finnel
  2. You need all three heart points to see these... I'll discuss how to handle
  this sort of stuff at the third heart point. It's more relevant there.

  Walk backward till you hit "Abundance of Friends". Then continue onward, jump
  up, and get [Burning Launcher]. Continue to the next save point. Near it is a
  [?Purifier?], and pick up "Defective Device?" on the platform above it. Keep
  ascending and you'll eventually be given a fork. Go west for a [?Leaf Box?],
  then continue along the north, where you'll eventually come to an elevator.
  The next one won't work, so don't bother continuing down the path.

  Go east for a fight. After, head west and keep climbing ladders till you can
  turn a switch. Climb up the last ladder for a [Platinum Material], then go
  down a couple levels to claim [V-Style: Winter Issue]. Now to the east. At
  the top is [?Rich Sack?], and the switch leads to [Big Book Of Soma]. Back to
  the previously blocked area.

  And you get to see J&K, finally. I'd like to know who gave her the implants.
  Go down the stairs to for a scene and fight. Afterward, ride the elevator
  back up and find the talk topic "You're Way Too Rough". Back to the no-
  encounter room and out the way you came.

  You'll eventually catch up, but they'll get away... just keep going. You'll
  get a trophy if you have a heart point with Finnel.

  Then you're forced into a U-turn. Back to Kniehar, take the west path, grab
  the [?For Fiesta?] in the area. Take the elevator, then the door you see.

  Go all the way west for [Battle Tape]. Get on the small platform and head up.
  Hit the blue thing from there and follow the path down. Use the next blue
  thing, walk across the pipe, then hit the next one to find [?Blind Mask?].
  Go back and hit the blue again, and follow the path out.

  Head west. At the next "block" you hit, you can jump up to a [Spark Stick],
  which is to the east of its particular block. Head across the walkway to the
  west to the next block, and you'll eventually hit a more obvious [?Spray?].
  Near that is a door. You'll be summoned to the Rinkernator... near the top of
  the Tower, of course. Then you'll be taken back to Archia.

  To Archia's Inn, stay there. If you have a heart point with Saki, trophy.

  You're going to lose Tatsumi forever. You have to do all party topics
  involving him now. Well, you've done so if you were following this guide! But
  also ensure that you've done all the Talk Topics that rely on him as well.

  Go find Tats at Nya Nya Ya, then find Gojo at Cross Bridge. Richa has strange
  tastes. I mean, ew, Gojo. After, you get the Hot Springs Encounter trophy.

  Make the ?Rich Sack? for a talk topic, and ?For Fiesta? for another. Don't
  forget ?Drill Blade?, which I mentioned earlier.

  To the rest of the Lymph Vessel. Up the lift again, hit the blue a couple
  times to get [?Revival Flute?] and [Mandragora], and hit it again to go
  outside. Head up till you get inside again, follow along to "Security
  Issues" (you won't be able to read it till CS5, but you can pick it up now),
  then back outside.

  You'll be next to a save point. To the west is [Rainbow Coat], and at the
  bottom level to the east is [Platinum Material]. Continue west to eventually
  come to an [Ice Pop Can] by a cylinder object, and, later, [?Popular Hat?].
  Back to the disc you passsed. Stand at the corner where the (!) icon pops up
  and ride the lift up. You'll be by [?Make Believe Set?].

  There isn't anything else here, so back to the beginning, then make your way
  to where Tyria was. Claim the [Soul Charger], go up the lift, then get
  [?Injector?]. To get out, go to the walkway between the first and second
  blocks and look for the lift boarding stand. Head inside from there and the
  rest is cake.

  With all that done, to the V-Board Racetrack for a trophy. Tatsumi is six
  feet under and you have a replacement now. A cute one. I know a couple of
  you probably didn't see it coming, but... those of us who played AT2 did.

  Talk to the soldier in the inn again for "About Taking Baths 2".

  A little note: Wait till the last save point (in Slave District, that is) to
  use up your talk topics on Saki. And do them all in a row. If you do that,
  you should be able to get I Want To Talk More 2 for Finnel at the beginning
  of Phase 3. If you don't see it, the only thing I did "special" was to have
  them both cleared up to CS4.

  And yes, I did use the same place as a section divider, for those of you who
  notice the little things. You enter to more of... Saki being Saki. Enjoy
  Akiko Shikata's nya-ing.

  Head up the lift and charge north. Once inside, head out on the other side,
  then go west and take the lift boarding stand. Go inside and take the lift,
  hit the blue switch, and go up the lifts to get to a save point and elevator.

  You'll wind up in the Slave District.

(   Heart Point   )
 `._____________.´
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Same deal here as last time, and there are talk topics which are influenced
  by heart points. I suggest giving a second point to whoever you gave the
  first one to. Strongly. Unless you really really hate trophies and additional
  scenes.

  Speaking of ends, if you like Cocona, she's "fourth" girl. She is, yet again,
  the non-committal ending. Oh, by the way, she's 13. Not 16. NISA's messin'
  with canon!

  And before you misunderstand my intentions: I was definitely annoyed with
  AT2, but not so much with AT3. It has a couple issues but I'm generally
  happy. However, I do want to know why Cocona jumped three years but Krusche
  didn't. Does time pass differently in Metafalss?

  Sure, it isn't pretty, but it works, right?!

  A note for the future: It's certainly possible to get out through E when you
  pass back through here, but who wants to walk through the Lymph Vessel?

  Might as well look at the machine a couple times; you'll be stopped. You
  start in #17. Head to the #16 for [Gold Material], then follow the kid to
  #23, grab another [Gold Material], and head into the vent. You're forced into
  a particular path, so up the ladder to #14 for [?Mode Clothes?].

  Head to #21 for [Stress Doll]. South of there is Mute. #9 contains some
  [Anti-Grav Gloves], #8 has [Shockback Band], #7 has [Soul Charger], and #6
  has [Inverse Chip]. Now down the stairs and through the alley. Saki will join
  you within #11, and comes attached to a Trophy. #4 has a shop in it, #3 has
  [Platinum Material], and #2 has yet another [Platinum Material].

  Take the outside manhole (labeled U1) to a [?Sowing Machine?], then take the
  vent within #11. There are two ladders down here. Take the north one for
  [?Roller Skates?] and climb up the boxes for "I'm Scared If It Rains". The
  other ladder leads out (labeled U2). #12 has [Heart Apron], #10 has nothing,
  and #15 has Gojo. If you have 2 hearts with Finnel, you'll get a talk topic
  because of the apron.

  Head all the way back to #14, then to the area outside #23 after the vent.
  On the south side of the outside area lies "Bad Environment". Back to #14,
  then #22 for [Soul Charger]. Enter the manhole labeled "M", grab the
  [V-Style: Extra Issue] to the north, and [Spark Stick] to the south.
  Then enter the furthest ladder for [?Freaky V-Board?].

  Enter #13 for Finnel and Coconut. Er, Cocona. #18 has a guy selling Nyo?
  Guts. Might as well buy one for later, though you'll have 99 by the time
  Phase 4 rolls around. To the exit for a fight. Poor Mute, always getting
  beaten up. She gets a new trick though. More than one, even.

  I'm sure you didn't expect THAT. (Well, when you first saw Mute, that is.)
  It's like the good folks at Gust sit around and try to make up weird weapons
  and absurd scenarios all day long.

  I love them all the more for it.

  For "I Want To Talk More 2", you need to talk to Saki three times, as stated
  in the previous section. For "Nightly Conversation 2", you need a lot of talk
  topics seen on top of CS6 being cleared.

  Continue along and you'll bump into a save point. Go north once you can and
  enter the door for a scene. Go south to get to the town map.

  Go to the Clustanian inn and pick up "Who'll Stay?". Head to the weapon shop
  north of the inn for "Mysterious Clustania". Outside the weapon shop, get
  "View of Clustania" (which is 22, not 21), then go to Paseo St. and buy a
  Funboon for "Bogus". Go all the way west there to pick up "Finnel's Home".

  Done? Then go to the very worst dungeon in the game: Clustania District!

  Huge thanks to Gust Wiki for helping me finish and organize this.

  Check out the north and east rooms for [Raw Meat] and [?Incense?]. Grab the
  [?Sparkling Water?] near 4F, then take that elevator for  [?Fishy Powder?].
  Go to the 3F elevator now.

  Get the [?Precious Metal Suit?], [Synchro Evo Sap], and [Yuteria Material]
  from this floor, then up to 5F. Yes, Finnel told you to go to 4F. Ignore her
  for now. Don't enter the ???? door, just grab [Headgear] and head to 6F for a
  [?Pistol?].

  Down to 3F, then to 4F. Claim [R2 Solvent], [Platinum Material], and
  [Gold Material], then head to 5F. Get [Burning Launcher] and up to 7F for
  [Soul Charger], [Ice Pop Can] and [Mandragora]. Now to 4F again, then 6F. Get
  [Spark Stick], [Twister Machine], [Heart Apron], [Shockback Band], and
  [Stress Doll]. On 8F, get [Battle Tape] and [Rainbow Coat], then onward to
  Harvy.

  EXEC_FLIP_FUSIONSPHERE/. And lots of plot.

  Head on down the elevator. You'll be with Saki, but you won't have far to go.

  You then have a conversation with whoever has 2 heart points. I can kinda see
  Richa's obsession with Gojo, but Katene has truly strange tastes. But~ Mute
  is one of my favorite NPCs, ever.

  In Akane's room is "Akane's Hobbies". Talk to the Reyvateil outside the Dive
  Shop for "I Want to Help". Leave Clustania to do your Diving, and make sure
  to synth ?Sparkling Water? and ?Incense? for talk topics. If you don't have
  Drappy Soda, Nya Nya Ya! You make Aurica's famed BBQ Soda. :D

    1. Make the ultra supermoves, if you haven't. They'll be the last
       synthable moves you can make. This isn't absolutely necessary, but
       it will make things MUCH easier.

    2. There's a missable Hyuma in Saki's CS7. Get it, and get it NOW.

  Ok, back to the district. I led you through everything, so just cut through
  to the exit on the fifth floor. Yay for maps. :P Up the lift, and approach
  the busted pod for a scene. Save point, up the stairs! And then march back
  down to the broken pod for "Did You Break Out?"

  Ok, back in the tower. Akane is kind enough to tell you to go right. Up the
  lift, then in the door nearby. The path there is straightforward, so get
  outside. Keep going till you hit a save point and warp.

  This is a fantastic place to create a split save. NG+ will not return you to
  the third heart point but rather... just after it.

    ___________
 .´¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯`.
(   Heart Point   )
 `._____________.´
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Last chance!

  Further, some recommendations as to how to handle ends. You can do this in
  whatever order, I'm just throwing one out there:

   1. Get the bad end.

   2. "Pure" Finnel Run, all Heart Points awarded to her. Get her ends.

   3. Restart from Phase 2, give Saki 2 heart points. Award her the final one
      and rush to her normal end, then go back to where you were (don't rely on
      NG+, use your own save!) and award the last point to Finnel.

   4. Get the remaining four ends. Do not enter Saki's CS8 or Tyria's CS3 till
      it's time to make the Glasteria Plate. You'll see why later.

  Remember, if you gave Saki 2 points and Finnel 1 heart, then you're locked
  out of Finnel's ends. As for how to get the True/Normal/Bad ends, that's
  coming in the next section.

  This guide is sort of written with "pure" Saki and Finnel runs in mind.
  However, any time I say "3 heart points", you can interpret that as
  "confession required". Just keep in mind that some of the relevant talk
  topics are availible earlier than the confession is (CS8 is availible pretty
  late in the game, especially for Saki).

  Anyway, talk to Akane, then Katene.

  EXEC_METEMPSYCHOSIS/.

  This is HIGHLY important. You are meant to lose the first time. Yes, you
  heard me. Get the bad end first! :P

  Ultimately, you can do the following:

   1. Lose, Stop Saki's song              (Bad End)
   2. Win/Lose, Do NOT stop Saki's Song   (Saki/Finnel Normal ends)
   3. Win, Stop Saki's song               (All other ends)

  The song isn't a choice you'll have yet. You have to advance in the plot.

  Lose does not mean "die". It means "let the time run out". And that takes
  about 7 minutes.

  Pay attention to the border of the field. It'll change from blue to red. It
  has other colors too, but red is the one to watch out for. That's the one
  that tells you to hurry it up.

  Supermoves (regular ones) let you purge faster if you use them on red beats.
  This is a very handy tip. When you build up enough burst, ultra supermoves!
  If you are a hardhead like I was, you need 600,000+ burst and a Flipsphere
  with your most powerful girl.

  If you lose, you really shouldn't bother with detours. Just get the game over
  with. Don't stop for treasure, whatever.

  If you win, you get rewarded with Tyria's amazing dialog. By the way,
  "Medley" is never explained by Trollia, but the 3 heart point scenes both
  show what can happen when one is a Medley. Medleys are also fairly important
  to the plot, despite being so unexplained.

    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
  Regardless of whether you won or lost, you have to go down; you will
  encounter Richa and Raphael either way. Take a lift to get out, then find
  your way to Harvy. Ayatane will pop up and Cocona will try to smack him down.
  Head down as far as you can to find Finnel. Pursue to 1F, then the slave
  district.

  In the room next to the save point, buy Nyo? Guts if you haven't already.

  Go to where Mute was (shiny manhole) and keep heading west. Cocona has enough
  time to kick ass AND save the girl. Ahem. Chase Kimono to the left, where
  there used to be a barrier.

  If you have 3 heart points, you get a trophy. So there are two to be had.

  Saki:

  Saki will make your jaw drop. Eternus Shaft, then the Gallery. Head east
  through the door, up the ladder, down another, up the next (it's not a
  complicated area, just follow the main path) and you'll have a scene. Now to
  Archia Think Tank.

  Oh, and you get Hyumas: Manjo Cruto, Memor Cruto

  Finnel:

  You'll be brought to Archia, so to the Think Tank. Head west, then through
  the second door and down the vent. Take the north way out, then head up the
  second ladder you see. In the door to the west for Akane. Out the way you
  came, then to Central Station.

  There are treasures to acquire in the Think Tank, but to align with Saki's
  route, I'll have you claim them later.

  EXEC_FLIP_ARPHAGE/. This is a fantastic song. This also happens to be THE
  song. Alfage who? No, seriously, a phage is an actual thing.

  Go all the way west for [Spunky Monkey V], [?BBQ?], [Yuteria Material]. Back
  to the fork and head north for [?Big Bottled Drink?]. At the next fork, head
  north to claim [Platinum Material]. South fork leads to [?Dreamy Crayon?] and
  another fork. North for [Angel Recoverael] and [Synchro Evo Sap], south for
  [?Wonder Tool?], [?Cutting Edge Kit?], [Spunky Monkey V], [?Premium Board?],
  and the save point.

  Good place to save!

  North to Saki, even though it looks like it's part of the, uh, island.

  Remember:
   1. Stop Song --> True/Bad ends
   2. Don't Stop -> Saki/Finnel Normal ends

  Note that I don't have you pick up chests. Waste of time and effort.

  If you don't stop the song, to the Archia Think Tank! Climb and go to the
  warp on the second disk, and find the warp in there. Ride the lift up, and
  you'll eventually come to a save point and lift. Climb the ladder and you'll
  be at Ku.

  The one and only song I hate :P You fight. She has an attack that will freeze
  your Reyvateil's song. Just wait the annoying thing out.

  Nugget time! Finnel's Cartology readings? It may seem like nonsense, but in
  Ar Ciel, the stars are pretty reliable. On a related note, this reading
  requires age, and Finnel is 11, not 17, because she was born as a 6 year old.
  If that made any sense. ;)

  If you stop the song... EXEC_ViiBaCi_MjiiRa/. Talk to Ms. Baddie to fight.
  She packs one hell of a punch, but she's cake compared to MYU. If you're on
  the bad end, this is the end. If you kicked MYU's metallic ass, keep
  followin'!

  But first, about NG+:

  1. You can restart from Phase 1, Phase 2, or the MYU Battle.

  2. If you restart from Phase 2 or the Battle, you only have your DP, level,
     and money preserved. The rest reverts to what it was at that point in the
     game. This, importantly, applies to the CS as well.

  3. Just 'cause you got that chest in Phase 3 and ignored it as you passsed
     back through Phase 3 on a subsequent run doesn't mean the game counts it
     as "opened". You have to open the chest again for the trophy.

  4. The same applies to Comospheres! Don't ignore events just because you did
     them at some point in the past. You have to do them again for the
     trophies.

  End of phase nugget: What is fried bread (agepan)? As far as I understand it,
  something very much like a donut. Yum.

  Before doing anything, walk to the Archia inn for "Undercover Bath" or "Co-ed
  Bathrooms" if you have 3 Heart Points with Saki or Finnel. You may have
  gotten this earlier.

  Regardless of route, go to the Pre-school for a scene. You may or may not get
  a talk topic though. Now to Akane's house, where plot happens. Then to Harvy
  in THAT place to finally get Tyria. Time to go to Archia, then the inn for a
  scene where Cocona and Mute talk (finally!).

  You'll find "Search" at the entrance. Once inside, get the [Stress Doll],
  [Inverse Chip], and [Soul Charger] in the rooms to the east.

  Go west and enter the second room to get to the basement and head south for
  "First Experiences". Head north when you can and continue across the bridge.
  Head east for "Can't Find A Dream", up the nearby ladder and west. You'll

  This is a great place to get the Purge Carnival Trophy, with all the cell
  phone monsters. You gotta have everyone in their underwear; supermoves and
  purge to level 3. Alternatively, the optional superboss works as well.
  There's also a Return to Innocence Trophy that requires you to purge three
  times at once. You can do that at the same time.

  Up the lifts till you hit a scene and fight. Before taking the next lift,
  turn around and take the middle one to [?Stick Medicine?]. The lift you were
  facing leads to [?Famous Protector?] and another lift. Up it, then the east
  lift for [?Radio?], then up the west left for a save point.

  Boss to the north, along with chmod b111000000/n

  By the way, the glossary entry about the Necrohouse of Ayatane should be
  available now (or maybe it'll be soon, as I'm writing this well after I
  completed the guide). I suggest you read it, whenever it pops up, as that'll
  clear up some confusion regarding the guy.

    If you're using the list I gave you earlier, you're probably wondering
    where the hell the remaining two chests in this area are. They're coming.

  Before Moochieriel, go to Nya Nya Ya for a talk topic. Tsundere and Dorodere,
  but she neglected to mention the Kuudere, unfortunately. And somehow they
  squeaked prinnies in there... I play too many JRPGs. ;)

  In Moocheriel, you know where to go already. EXEC_COSMOFLIPS/. You... can't
  win the battle through normal means, so go ahead and lose.

  If you feel like going the extra mile to beat her:

  Take the east door. In a room next to the save point is "Secret Base". Follow
  the path to a ladder and just keep following the ladders till you hit a door.
  Inside is VR21. After the scene, you end up by "Clean-Up" and "Nostalgia".
  Talk to Katene for a scene with Mute. She's a much better character than you
  thought she'd be, right? :P

  Rest and Tyria will let you Dive into her "CS". You should do so for some
  talk topics (including some for Saki/Finnel), and some references to Hama and
  Infel. You're actually required to clear her CS2.

  Afteward, back to Moocheriel, pick up "Creepy...", and head to the center.
  Round Two! She's tough, so you're probably going to lose a lot of your good
  healing items.

  Curiously, Cocona spoke Standard Hymnos instead of Pastalie. It isn't absurd
  or incorrect for an IPD to do so, just curious. Probably has to do with
  vocabulary limitations.

  Oh, and since I'm busy giving you a nugget, remember all that time ago when I
  was gabbing about the namesakes of Fallen Heaven and Blue Heaven Peak?
  Datenkou has another name -- Sarapatra/Salapator. So next time you go to
  Fallen Heaven Peak, you're really on Sarapatra's breast. Just kidding. :P

  Only two go by their Japanese names: Saki and Suzunomia. Suzunomia's real
  name is Hymmnosphere, and Saki's is, confusingly enough, Sakia Lumei.

  You know where the dive machine is by now. After resting, you should be able
  to complete Finnel's CS8 and CS9... if you're on her route. You get Blue
  Beach Sandals for doing so.

  There are topics for both Saki and Finnel that are unlocked by talking to
  Tyria 4 times. Just a heads up. Also, one of Saki's requires that you talk to
  her 3 times.

    1. It's important that you don't equip the Blue Beach Sandals for certain
       talk topics. The same applies for Handheld Saki and Love Beep
       Messengers. Keep them in your inventory; it's easier that way.

    2. Leave some talk topics around for Saki and Finnel. 3 each should be
       fine. You'll miss TWO from Tyria if you don't. I'll tell you when you
       can use the three you save. Be very careful with Saki's topics.
       Apparently, Why Are You So Energetic disappears. So save anything but
       that.

  To the town menu for a new emergency.

  In Archia, you'll hear Akane's 100th excuse for not joining the party. Talk
  to someone (I don't know who triggers it) in Cross Bridge for "A Pervert?",
  then make the ?Radio? for a talk topic (but only if you cleared Tyria's CS3).

  In the Think Tank, head left and go into the second room's vent. Take the
  north exit, and go up the first ladder you run into for a scene and boss.

  Once in the Tower of Origin, up the lifts. Always go left when in doubt. When
  you hit the scene where Krusche FINALLY finds what she's looking for, turn
  around and march back inside for "How Quiet", then outside. You'll claim
  [Synchro Evo Sap] and [?Stuffed Animal?] on your way up. Keep following
  through a warp and till you hit a second lift. Don't take it; go west.

  In the XP Shell, go north to get [?Shiny Clothes?] and [?Mythic Armor?].
  Ignore the door and save point for now; the northwest has [?Ultimate Drill?]
  and [?Vintage Board?], and the southwest area has [?Maiden Tears?].

  Through the door for EXEC_Z/. and a boss fight. The song sounds upbeat, but
  the lyrics are anything but. Oh, are you too busy watching the jiggle physics
  to read this? Or wondering if she's wearing underwear? ;)

  You can now clear Saki's CS8 and CS9 for a Handheld Saki. Make a ?Dreamy
  Crayon? for a talk topic upon completion. Make ?Shiny Clothes? (you may have
  to go shopping in Ciela Gate) for three talk topics. You'll need another set
  of Lethal Frills (?Magic Frills?) for it. Then make ?Mythic Armor? for a talk
  topic.

  This is, by the way, the last Saki Talk Topic aside from one you pick up at
  Ku. If you don't have some, they're CS related or battle related. This is why
  I told you to save three topics. You still need to hang onto them.

  Enter the Clustania District for a scene with Akane. I don't know how long
  you have to do it. To advance the plot, back to Archia and the Old Clinic,
  then to Cross Bridge to find Akane.

  Go to Paper Scissors in Blue Canyon Hamlet to find Mute/Katene for a talk
  topic. Outside Aoto's home is "How Presumptuous!", but only if Tyria
  confessed.

  Now to Clustania, and the game is kind enough to take you to Harvy. Rest at
  Clustania for what I think triggers a talk topic. ...Well, I think resting
  there at some point triggers it, so it should be damn near automatic. It's a
  weird one.

  What kind of lame security does a tower have if you need to separate stuff by
  large distances? Come to think of it... there has been a virus and/or hacker
  in each game that has wreaked serious havoc. Tower security is lame indeed.
  Might as well give me an elevator to make it easier.

  Oh, this is a guide and not Drache commentary hour? :(

  Go inside to the west, then up the Vacuum Tube and the lift. Tyria will open
  the way. Pick up "Who's Prepared", [?Star Can?], "Man-Eating Tower",
  [Spunky Monkey V], [?Fishy Needle?], [?Protein?], [Yuteria Material],
  and "You're Scared, Right?". Then take the warp up.

  Follow the path till you find another warp, which leadsto [?Fashionista?] and
  [Angel Recoverael]. Then take the next warp outside. In this area, claim
  [?Eye Wear?], [Synchro Evo Sap], and [?Glass Jar?] before proceeding.

  If you have 3 heart points or have accepted a confession, you get a scene
  with that girl. If you're curious, I have a youtube link, but only for Tyria,
  as the other two seemingly don't exist.

  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DADHezZ7ix0

  Carry along till you hit "What A Twist!", then "Way Too Complicated" by the
  save point. Up the lift and ladder. Just like in the normal end, you fight
  battle mode. chmod, again.

  The Ayatane mentioned is not Kureha, as Terus don't live more than 200 years.
  Kureha himself was 87.

  Afterward, drop down on the south side and pick up "Are You Going to Die?".
  One more party topic~ Head down the ladder and go north for the exit. It
  doesn't look like an exit, but it is!

  If you have not cleared Tyria's CS2, do so now. You cannot progress till you
  have done so. Keep in mind, however, for 100% completion you have to get
  every end in CS3.

  Go to Akane's home for a scene. Poor girl :) This scene gets me. Every. Time.
  You need to do it for a Finnel topic (3 hearts needed). For more optional, go
  to the inn at Archia.

  I'm sure you've noticed that there isn't a maidroid in this game. Assuming
  you aren't an Ar tonelico noob, of course. Well, instead, you get to fight
  Akane. Optionally.

  She's in the Clustania District if you're interested, but she'll own you if
  you're not very high in level due to her high attack power. Just a warning. I
  beat her with relative ease at level 80 with the best equipment. Time to spam
  ultra supermoves.

  To fight again, enter and exit the area and run from five battles.

   Fight 1: ?Medical God Tool?  +  Extra Special Image 1.
   Fight 2: ?Legend Board?      +  Extra Special Image 2.
   Fight 3: ?Mythic Weapon?     +  Extra Special Image 3.

  Tyria.

  southeast lift, south lift, and you can figure out the rest. Damn Harvy.

  EXEC_REBIRTHIA=PROTOCOL/. Hm, another name? That is one of the few changes
  that bug me.

  Afterward, go to Nya Nya Ya.

  Remember when I told you to save three talk topics for both Saki and Finnel?
  Now is the time to use them, one girl at a time to be safe, and then talk to
  Tyria.

  There is a shortcut to where you're going. You'll miss the scenes if you take
  it. You will need to return because the game is a jerk, and you're free to
  take the shortcut then.

  Climb up to the elevator, but ignore it in favor of the next one. You'll pass
  two save points and get a scene near the second. North it is. Climb down the
  ladder you come to and follow to an elevator. Down the next ladder for
  [Rare Metal]. When given the chance, go east for [Platinum Material].

  Go along the other path till you get to... MYU. No time limit, but DAMN.
  Why can't my level 99 Krusche help in the battle, huh? Just kidding. About
  the level. I still want my Krusche.

  Once you're taken back to Archia, march your butt right back to where you
  fought MYU 2. Jerkfaces at Gust don't want you to have treasure.

  The shortcut is through Kniehar Signal Station. So to the Lymph Vessel, exit
  east, and make your way down to Garvelt. You get [?Ultimate Liquid?] and
  [?Ultimate Material?] for going. Those are otherwise rare items (Yuteria
  Material, Synchro Evo Sap).

  This is a great place for making a split save if you want to maximize your
  runs... assuming you followed my advice and didn't enter CS8 of Saki/Finnel
  or Tyria's CS3 and thus avoided confessions.

  If you have not cleared Tyria's CS3 and you want her normal end, do so NOW.
  For her true, you can do it a bit later. You get Love Beep Messengers for
  finishing it.

  If you're on Finnel's route, go see Akane, as this event will expire shortly.
  Make ?Star Can?, because you should be able to with your ?Ultimate Liquid? in
  hand. If you cleared Finnel's CS9, make ?Glass Jar? for another talk topic.

  Afterward, make the Glasteria Plate (it'll be under Key). You should have
  plenty of the materials needed, though you can still buy them in Clustania.

  If you're on Tyria's route, this is where the big decision comes in. Her
  normal end is quite painless; no elaborate obviously-not-right end this time.

  Go to Cross Bridge to find Cocona. March up to Nya Nya Ya to grab "Piles of
  Treasure" that you've undoubtedly been staring at. Tower of Origin, up the
  stairs and to the otherwise useless elevator.

  METHOD_HYMMELI/.

  Talk the the soldier in the inn for "Metafalsians Love Baths", the last party
  topic. Run around town for a bunch of events. You can even go into the office
  of the Think Tank. Then run to Paper Scissors of Blue Canyon Hamlet. In
  Eternus Shaft, go to the Bistro for a jillion meal tickets. Then drop by
  Akane.

  Tower of Origin, climb to the elevator but go left instead. Through the door.
  Talk to Harvestasha when you're ready.

  Point of no return!

  You get caught in a fight. Once you gain control, take the northeast till you
  hit a dead end, then go to the other side. Head west for [Angel Recoverael],
  the last treasure. You'll get a trophy if you got the rest. Continue for a
  fight. Ah, the beeping's gone.

  Continue along for the save point and a door. You get a few moments to yap to
  everyone. Endings do affect dialog (except Cocona). Talk to Tyria to finish
  up the game. You get into two fights. The first is pretty easy, just watch
  out for suicide bombers.

  Oh yes, XaaaCi. for the first boss. The final boss has Ec Tisia ~Tarifa~ and
  several other untitled variants of Ec Tisia. Ec Tisia itself is the credits
  song.

  It's weird, but just keep whacking at the antibodies. This is a four part
  battle and the music will change at each part. Don't attack Ciela. Oh, and
  just once, be sure to use a non-Flipsphere attack on Ciela. There's something
  you won't see otherwise.

  Remember, NG+ lets you start from various points. Battle of Fate doesn't let
  you do the heart point right before it.

  By the way, there's a third option when Saki or Finnel asks Aoto why he likes
  them. Scroll down. :P You may need 3 heart points though.

  There's a post game novel out there that tells what happens to Tyria (among
  other things). I don't know the details, but I do know this: they lived
  happily ever after. And the tower fell.

Exchange "3 heart points" with "confession required" if you have a 2:1 heart
point ratio.

Generic CYA statement: I say timed for a few things. Thank you Gust Wiki. But
I don't generally know the cut-off. So I tell you when you can start and then
you're on your own.

CS Cleared Topics: You probably need the Blue Beach Sandals unequipped for some

Exchange "3 heart points" with "confession required" if you have a 2:1 heart
point ratio.

Generic CYA statement: I say timed for a few things. Thank you Gust Wiki. But
I don't generally know the cut-off. So I tell you when you can start and then
you're on your own.

CS Cleared Topics: You probably need the Handheld Saki unequipped for some
talk topics to pop up.

Phase is omitted because they're all in Phase 4.

You do not have to be on Tyria's route to get all topics. She will confess to
you upon clearing her CS3's true end. Then, regardless of acceptance, she'll
act like Aoto's lover and you'll get otherwise locked talk topics.

Generic CYA statement: I say timed for a few things. Thank you Gust Wiki. But
I don't generally know the cut-off. So I tell you when you can start and then
you're on your own.

CS Cleared Topics: You probably need the Love Beep Messengers unequipped for
some talk topics to pop up.

There's a slight spoiler. :P

Generic CYA statement: I say timed for a few things. Thank you Gust Wiki. But
I don't generally know the cut-off. So I tell you when you can start and then
you're on your own.

Tatsumi's topics die after the V-Board race in Phase 2. That I promise you.

Completing Finnel is sooo much easier than Saki.

Generic CYA statement: Optional means "not required to get a paradigm shift".
It does not mean that you should skip it if you want the 100% trophy. A couple
CAN be skipped, but I wouldn't skip them if I were you.

DP is for all of them.

There is nothing too complicated about these. No choices, no optionals.

the fifth level.

There's a bit of optional at the beginning. It's a waste of DP. I'm fairly

My optional DP count is possibly a little off, btw.

And don't you ever convince yourself otherwise! It's a rumor; kill it!

It is perfectly possible to get 100% on your 348374th playthrough, your
umpteenth save, whatever! Just do it all, and do it in one run!

Don't screw around here. If it looks important, do it!

I don't think the super hidden, non-starred events are necessary for 100%. I
make you no promises.

If you see two places to go to at the same time, never go to Tyria's home. You
will crash. That Hyuma is a lie, for the time being.

Otherwise, nothing matters.

DLC NOTE: If you installed the Elemia DLC, delete ATQ under Game Data Utility
          so that you can get Nam. If you aren't an obsessive completionist,
          Nam really isn't worth the hassle.

11. Tyria's Home
    - "Talk a little bit longer."

After all this, Tyria will remember her song.

If you can't clear this level, make absolutely certain you followed this to the
letter. If you still can't, I can't really help you.

If you have the NA version, I ask that you send me your save, as I'd really
like to see that odd glitch. And if it doesn't happen to me, I'll send you back
your save with the level cleared (though it'll likely ruin your chances of
platinum). Keep in mind that it will absolutely be faster to avoid email and
find me *any* other way.

               guide for that too, it's okay. :P
    - Bad:    "Go home." Do this first, Tyria will let you do this choice again
               so long as you said "Can you swim?" earlier.
    - Normal:  Doesn't matter

14. Kurogane Lab
    - Trophy

After getting the good end, rest and Tyria will fess up and you can get another
trophy for accepting her confession.

Be sure to get all the ends for 100% completion.

There are so many trophies that I combined quite a few related ones.

Many of these require you to do it within a single playthrough. In fact, assume
they require one run unless otherwise stated.


Finale of Ar Ciel     Platinum!


Synthesis Newbie      Perform 10 new synth sessions.
The Mixer                     30 new synths
The Alchemist                 60 new synths


4 Phase Beaters       Automatic. Just play the game.


9 Cosmosphere         Unlock 30, 60, and 100% of all girls cosmospheres.
Trophies              Tyria's requires you to get all her ends. Saki's is a
                      pain in the ass. Must do in one run. You can get the
                      trophies using NG+, but be careful.


8 End Trophies        See ending section.


"Nothing, Ma!"        Hit the Panic Button (select) 100 times while diving.


3 Battle Trophies     Be victorious in battle 100, 200, and 300 times.


The Peon              Flee 100 times


The Ravager           Encounter Bar depleted 25 times


Our Valued Customer   Play the game for 100 hours. You can do this across
                      multiple saves; the game keeps track.


Master of Unlocking   Open all chests.


Free of the Rat       Max money. I didn't do this myself, but I shall refer you
Race                  to MasterLL's technique: Synth Lethal Frills like crazy.
                      Do this after Mrs. Reyvinson. :P

Mrs. Reyvinson        Have someone's DP max out (99,999).


Super Guru            Have everyone at level 99. There are plenty of great late
                      game grinding places for this.


Save Obsession        Save 100 times
Syndrome

Return to Innocence   Take off 3 pieces of clothes at once. Easy in Phase 4.


Purge Carnival        Reyvateil Purged 3 times, Vanguards stripped (use ultra
                      supermoves).


22 Event trophies     Just... read the walkthrough. <_< A couple are related to
                      heart points. Others are related to CS events. Basically,
                      if you get a CG, you get a trophy too.

This section includes some spoilers. It's all also in the guide at the relevant
points.

I will refer to "Saki's song" quite a bit. It comes very late in Phase 3, and
is called EXEC_FLIP_ARPHAGE/. Alternatively, thanks to NISA, Alfage.


About NG+
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This is quite relevant to 100% completion and efficiently getting ends, so I
suggest you understand how it works.

1. You can restart from Phase 1, Phase 2, or the MYU Battle (notably, right
   AFTER the last heart point)

2. If you restart from Phase 2 or the Battle, you only have your DP, level, and
   money preserved. The rest reverts to what it was at that point in the game.

3. Just cause you got that chest in Phase 3 and ignored it as you passsed back
   through Phase 3 on a subsequent run doesn't mean the game counts it as
   "opened". You have to open the chest again for the trophy.

4. The same applies to Comospheres! Don't ignore events just because you did
   them at some point in the past. You have to do them again for the trophies.


Bad end
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
1. Lose MYU battle. Meaning you should let the time run out, not die.

2. Stop Saki's song.


Heart Points
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
At a few points in Phases 2 and 3, you can choose between Saki and Finnel.
Doing so awards you a heart point toward one of them.

Three points is basically an auto confession, and you'll be locked into a
particular set of ends. 2:1 ratio locks you out of whoever has one point, but
also allows you into three other ends.


Saki + Finnel Normal Ends
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It's best to give them all three points so that you get the extra scenes and
trophies. You don't need to do that for the ending trophy itself, but you damn
well should!

1. MYU battle does not matter.

2. Do not stop Saki's song. This is the important bit.


All True ends
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
1. Win MYU battle. You have approximately 7 minutes to do so.

2. Stop Saki's song.

For Saki and Finnel, have 3 heart points. Alternatively, have a 2:1 ratio, then
dive into CS8 for a confession. The confession only happens for the one with 2
points.

For the other three ends, you should give them a 2:1 ratio and reject
Saki/Finnel in CS8. Or really, don't enter at all.


Cocona End
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
True end route, 2:1 heart point ratio. Reject any confessions.


Tyria's Ends
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
True end route, 2:1 heart point ratio, clear CS3 for the best end, then accept
the following confession at the inn.

After making the Glasteria Plate:

1. For her normal end, choose Tyria over the world.

2. For her true end, choose the world over Tyria. This is still a happy end,
   but it's only covered in a novel.


Recommendations
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
1. Get the bad end

2. Get Finnel's ends, award all heart points to her and don't bother with the
   rest of the junk.

3. Restart from Phase 2. Award two heart points to Saki. Create split save
   before MYU battle and final heart point. Give the last point to Saki and
   rush to her normal end.

4. Return to your split and award the last point to Finnel. Do not pass Tyria's
   CS2 or Saki's CS7 till it's time to make the Glasteria Plate. Create a new
   split here and go for the rest of the ends.
