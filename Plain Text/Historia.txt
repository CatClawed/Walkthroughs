The reality of email is that I don't respond to it often. I advise against
asking me questions, as chances are I'll see them a week later or so and I will
assume you either figured it out or moved on by that point.

Feel free to leave a note if you want me to respond no matter how late I get
to it. This does not guarantee response, but it makes it MUCH more likely.

This guide is written with the assumption that you are following it from the
beginning.

You should be able to find your place should you not be. But if you decide to
follow the guide at some point in the middle of your playthrough, you may have
to hop around a bit to find a lot of sidequest information. I try to maximize
playthroughs so that you won't be doing a ton of time traveling.

Sidequests will get tedious if you decide to do them at the end of the game.

Completionists, I will not help you with items you acquire from monsters. Don't
even ask.

Furthermore, special thanks to OLDHAG for listing the sidequests. It helped me
get quite a few of the ones I missed on my first run.

http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/604160-radiant-historia/58266464

And if all you want is a plain sidequest list, I suggest you look at that.

This game is pretty straightforward, but still fun.

Grid
¯¯¯¯
Your enemies will be on any of 9 squares, sometimes occupying more than one.
Pushing them in the back will reduce the damage they dish out, and the damage
you give to them. This is actually more important than it sounds.

You can play offensively and drag your enemy to the front to kill them as fast
as possible -- at the risk of getting hit harder and dying -- or you can shove
'em in the back and try healing.

Launching into the Sky
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
There are a couple attacks that allow you knock your enemy up -- twice. I don't
find these very useful over left/right/up/down techniques, but if you hit your
enemies after they're in the air, they take damage upon landing. In fact, they
take half the damage from landing as they get while hit in the sky.

If you use a mana break while they're floating, you can get deal impressive
damage.

Knock Enemies into Each Other
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
There are many techniques that allow you to move your enemies around. Use that
to knock them into each other, and you'll hit them all at once!

Combo!
¯¯¯¯¯¯
You chain your attacks together. In other words, have everyone attack the same
enemy or group of enemies to increase the chain. Some skills have multiple
hits associated with them.

This doesn't sound like much, but really, the more you chain, the more damage
you dish out. So have a big magic nuke attack at the end and you'll see some
impressive amounts of HP flowing out of the enemy.

Change
¯¯¯¯¯¯
You can change turns with enemies. This will enable you to create better combos
at the risk of taking more damage before your turn comes back up.

Mana Burst
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You can also use these to delete enemy turn panels or unleash devastating
attacks. Well, they may be fairly useless attacks as well. You have to get hit
a lot to fill the gague enough. :P

Poison
¯¯¯¯¯¯
This deserves its own section.

USE. IT. In the form of the item, Poison Wing, or the skills you get. It won't
work on a few bosses, sure, but it helps with a lot of the difficult ones.

Woohoo, 500g. Oh, right. Grab the Soothing Balm x2 from the chest to the left,
take the elevator to the third floor to grab the Charm on the right, and go
down to 1F. Enter the door to the right to claim Holy Water and Herbal Tea x2.

Run south to the next screen, the Second Ward. Up all the stairs to the right
and follow the path to the Herbal Tea chest. To the next south screen. Again
up the stairs to the right for a chest of 300G. Check the Inn's rooms for Beast
Skins. South again to exit.


================
  Lazvil Hills
================

You'll be forced into where you go and what you fight for a while. So go ahead
and do the tutorials.

Go ahead and leave to the east when you gain control. South of the dead tree is
Soothing Balm x3. You'll come to another scene. Get the Royal Jelly x3 from the
south and head back north for another battle. Continue north to learn how to
attack enemies before encounters.

Put them to sleep to gain the advantage. This makes the game soooo much easier.

Anyway, head east to the next screen. You can't kill those trees yet for that
chest, so head to the bridge. Scene, unwinnable fight, scene.

Do-over time. Head south and through the barricade. Fight, then you'll be at
the exit. Ouch.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

You're at the major split. It is from here that history separates into
Alternate and Standard. Don't be afraid to use the Mana Crystals you'll get,
but don't overuse them. Buying them is expensive.

Find Rosch up the stairs. Can't miss him. Choose to work with Rosch for now.
You'll be coming back to Heiss soon.

  Lazvil Hills
================

Follow the path west, then take the southwest path to the next screen. Then go
across the bridge and take the southwest path. You'll be by the barricades.
Head north to the next screen and enter the cave for Bronze Mail. Up to the
road now, where you'll find a merchant. West to exit.


=============
  Alma Mine
=============

You'll enter to a scene with an informant.

Wait in ambush -> Bad End
Send Scouts ----> Continue

There's no penalty for seeing the bad end. You can always go back and redo your
decision. This applies for sidequests too. It doesn't matter which you do first
either.

Anyway, you won't be able to do much else in this time because you need to save
the merchant in the other one. And you have to meet the informant here to
continue the story in the other time, so it goes both ways.

Poke around the area for 200G and Soothing Balm x3, but it's to Historia with
you.

Go to Alma Mine ----> Bad End

And then head south. Twice, to arrive at the barricades. You'll come to a boss

You'll be taught how to use bombs. Yay. Head west then south to leave. You
probably want to go back to Alistel's Inn to heal beforehand.


===================
  Judgement Cliff
===================

Talk to the guy as you enter. He explains that some enemies cannot be moved.
There isn't all that much to do in this area, so head north, north, north.
You'll exit.


=================
  Sand Fortress
=================

There are traps in the middle of the road. Buy two Anti-Sleeps from the
merchant for a sidequest.

I'll be guiding you through the treasure of this place when there aren't enemies
crawling all over it. So for now, you can look on your own or rush to
the boss. For the boss, head up to the third floor and follow the very obvious
eastern path. You'll find him.

Keep heading north to the next screen. Head northwest to see some guards

also quite possibly the best character in the game except for a couple enemies,
the final boss included.

Approach the gate now. You won't be able to continue for the time being.

Abandon the idea -------> Continue (in a bit)

Once you can control, go west for a scene. You see them barrels? Blow up the
rocks in front of you. Then drag a barrel to the east and blow up those rocks.
Grab your Heavy Mail and back to the west, then north to the next screen.

Follow the path to the shiny. You can get Mana Shards and Crystals from those
sometimes when you hit them. Head north, then northwest for some barrels. Push
those northeast, then scene. Le gasp, cave in.

Northwest with ya. Grab 800G, then back to the initial path. Head all the way
west, grab Royal Jelly x4, save, and blast your way through the rocks. Then
blast your way through the next set for a Healing Herb. Boss in the next room.

Well, I say boss, but it's really a bunch of mooks. Group a few of them
together at a time and wipe them out.

Before doing anything, go back to where you saved Aht and do some plant killing
for a First Aid Kit.

Approach the gate and make your way through. Take the southwest path to reach
Gran Plain W (not South Hill), then south from there to Forest Clearing for a
scene. You'll be roped into finding food and firewood.

To the north screen to learn Mana Sight, so now you can see invisible things.
You have walked over invisible treasure already, lol.

Head west and whack your way through the giant weeds. You'll find a second
Withered Branch here. Claim the Holy Water and continue to the east. To the
north of the Gran Plain area, drag the barrel to the east to claim a Bishop's
Stud. Futher north under the tree root is another Withered Branch. Follow the
northwest path, then cling to the east side of the new area for your fourth
branch.

Aht will tell you to go to South Hill. Proceed south twice, but save before
the second screen. By a tree to the south is the fifth. Then you have a scene
and fight.

along the way.

To proceed, you have to disarm bombs. If you don't, they'll explode and you'll
be forced to repeat this node. This is why Mana Sight is needed. To the east of
1F is a hidden chest with Emerald, and the eastern room has a bomb. Next to the
third room is another bomb. Move the barricade within the room for a hidden
chest of 2000G.

On 2F, take the west door to find a hidden Panacea Plus. Behind that room is
the third bomb. Keep following the path to the barricade, and claim the hidden
Mana Crystal x2 behind it. The next room along the path has the fourth bomb.

On 3F, head west to disarm the final bomb. Go east and keep going till you find
more barricades and a hidden Leaf Ring.

      Near the save point is a sparkling patch of flowers. Talk to the person
      there and get a flowering bud.

Snoop around on the west side of town to find a hidden Crystal Charm. Then go
north for Rosch. After the scenes, go back to where Rosch is for hidden Anti-
Paralytic x2.

And because I really can't remember this area well enough and my game is shoved
deep in my closet, here's a mostly direct quote from someone else:

"In the small screen outside Celestia on the west side, there's a hidden 3000G.

North of the Celestia exit to Lasvil, there's a ramp, and a bunch of slashable
trees to the left. There's a Celestial Tea in a chest on the right side,
completley obscured by background."


================
  Lazvil Hills
================
Go to the south of the area for Herbal Tea x2. Head north and come to some
rocks and an invisible barrel. On the west side is a hidden Rune Claw. Past the
plants is Healing Herb x2. Go north for another set of rocks, then west. You
can't take the bridge, so south. There, you'll have a scene next to the save
point.

You won't make it far before you meet up with Vanoss. To the east of the weapon

By now, you know Lazvil Hills in and out. I'll spare you the direction. :P


============
  Celestia
============

You enter to a fight. This is one I recommend Gafka for, due to his high
attack. Get rid of the defenders first and the rest of the fight goes somewhat
smoothly. I beat them in the early 20's, if you want a number.

Once you gain control, speak with Rosch, Raul, then Barranca.

Nominate Raul --> Bad end

Head out of the bar and back to the alley. You found your next dungeon. You'll
find the two thieves soon after entry.

North to the next screen, cross the ramp, then the other one, and go to the
east screen. Follow that walkway to a switch. Back to the second screen, and
take the south exit that the thieves came from. Follow that path east, and
you'll see the thieves again. Go where they came from to get Herbal Tea x2.

Take the southern east path for Special Tea x2. Then go back and take the
northern one. Flip the switch in the second north path. South, then west. Go
down the eastern south path to a switch. Then go down the other one. Go down
both west paths for a Mail Vest and hidden 2000G, then to the east screen.

Talk to the little girl. THIS IS NOT A SIDEQUEST. Saving her now saves you
the trouble of doing it later.

Take the two eastern paths to a hidden Panacea x2 and Wind Armlet. Back to
where you came from.

From the second screen, head east twice. Take the eastern north path for Mana
Crystal x2. Take the other north path and cling to the south side for a hidden
Medicloth. Toward the light, and follow the path to another part of the sewer.

Hit the switch and take the southern east path for hidden 2000G. Then go for
the ladder to be done with this place.


==========
  Castle
==========

Exit the area for a scene. Since you know Vanish, you can overcome this
obstacle.

Stick to stealth --> Continue
I'll be the decoy -> Bad end

Go up the stairs and to the right. In there is 2000G, hidden. Back down, and
go in the west door. Follow the path outside, and check out the west side of
the area for hidden 2000G. Save and approach the vines~

It's a bunch of mooks. Kill the archers, as always. Run out the way you came.

Before entering the jail, get the Cocktail Dress and hidden Mana Crystal x3
from the adjacent room. Once inside jail, you'll automatically be taken out.

After all that, go north for a scene. Drag the barrel to its obvious
destination for a Sprig Ring. To the elder. Then out of town.

Once in Granorg, keep heading north. Eventually you'll see Will dying. To the
bar. On the way, you'll save Aht from a bunch of mooks. You'll get the Black
Page and a new Mana Burst with it.

In the bar, Eruca joins your party. Remember saving that girl? This is when it
comes into play, and at one future point. Time to get out.

To Sand Fortress. If you don't know your way around, shame on you. :P


===================
  Judgement Cliff
===================

Enter to a scene, then head south twice. You can finally take the west path.
Rocks will be falling. You'll come across a hidden barrel. Blow up the rocks to
the south for a Healing Fruit, then continue west. In the next screen, go north
till you find a hidden barrel on the west side, and blow up the rocks for Life
Robe.

Proceed to the west path now. To the south are a bunch of hidden traps. You can
go around them to get Sniper Rounds. You can't get the treasure to the west
right now, so go north. The cave has a Power Down Plus. Outside is your camping
ground. Investigate the area for hidden 2000G. Might as well save before
continuing.

Leave it to Marco --> Bad end
Deal with the Fire -> Continue (after a hiccup)

You'll have an easy one on one fight. You get a particular item that you need
in the other timeline. The solution to his guard tech is to use Fire.

To "The Closed Mine" in the prologue. While there, sidequests! Be sure to read
a little ahead. If you don't, you'll be going back and forth. I grouped them
together for your convenience.

      turn for Marco and have your Mana Bursts ready. Let him use Kiai Charge
      twice, then delete his turns and FIRE, because it's his weakness. Use
      Trans-turn to get more fire in. It took about 10 hits for me to kill him,
      Magic boosted by Marco.

      now.

Talk to Elm. This is actually required.

Ok, Lazvil Hills. You know the drill... right? I actually grinded a little
here because the enemies were kicking my ass. I got up to level 31 with Stocke.

  | Everything is weak to lightning. However, the Clockworks will self        |
  | destruct each and every turn, then the Thaumachine summons more. Defend   |
  | through the first four bombings to survive. You can level Rosch up to the |
  | point where he takes out the entire row in one hit with Gull Swing, or    |
  | you can push/pull the Thaumachine into two of them, zap, then take out    |
  | the third. At the end, he'll spam Bull Crash a lot, which can easily kill |
  | someone. BTW, if you have G-Fire with Raynie, that should do more damage. |
  |                                                                           |
  | In any case, the easiest way to do this is to have everyone alive after   |
  | killing some Clockworks, then to turn break with everyone and use G-Fire  |
  | as much as possible (which, ideally, includes Marco using Trans-Turn).    |
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

That's one of the harder boss battles. Anyway, you'll be back in Celestia.

Ok, time to explore town. Within the inn is First Aid Kit x4. To the east just
outside the inn is a hidden (gasp!) 2000G. Behind the barricades to the west
are Healing Fruit and Special Tea x2. To the west screen. Check on the east
and west sides of the area for hidden barrels. Drag those to the western rocks
for a hidden Feather Armlet.

Back to the east screen, then to the north screen. Be sure to save before going
that way.

  | Use Poison Trap or a Poison Wing, then keep knocking him left and right   |
  | into other types of traps. The poison should keep Breath from restoring   |
  | any of his HP. You probably will have to revive Aht, but try to kill      |
  | quickly.                                                                  |

Head south for a scene. Go to the Central Plaza, then north. Talk to the guy by
the torch. He'll rope you into, OMG, more fighting. This is why I wanted Aht to
have all the best stuff. In fact, if you have trouble, try upgrading her
equipment first. Head south, then talk to the man standing by the two who are
arguing.

First fight is, essentially, a bunch of mooks. Easy ones.

Second fight is with Bram and Hertz. Take 'em out one at a time, but don't let
them stay in formation. You may want to use your turn breaks to keep Bram from
killing you.

Third fight is against the guy in charge.

Stop Aht -----------> Continue (in a bit)
Go with Aht's plan -> Bad end

Go to AH Chapter 4, "A New Alliance" to learn the skill you need. Then return
to "Chi-Clad Warrior" and kick his ass.

Poison him, and hit as many times as possible before he buffs himself up. But
he'll go down real quick, even with the buffs.

Prizes: Emerald, Madre Blade, Gospel Armor.

Don't attempt the next two fights (sidequests, really). You might be able to
do the first one with some turn breaks, but the second? Oh hell no.

(Or rather, it is possible to do the second, but I very strongly don't
recommend it, as it's a very tedious process.)

Go back to the guy by the torch to get your info. Then talk to the guard in
front of the door and find Eruca... and Marco and Raynie.

Take Aht out of your party. Now. She's useless against giant enemies. Fetch
Eruca, save, and head south till you fight.

      the green haired lady.

    • Go to "A New Battle" back in chapter 4 and talk to the barkeep. Then back
      to "Scorching Battlefield" and talk to Mimel.

      Capture Mimel -> Bad end, and quite worth seeing!
      Let Mimel Go --> Continue

    • Back to Ricky to finish. You get Sable Larme.

To Garland.

Stay in Cygnus -> Bad end
Lead the Way ---> Continue

Even though I said continue, you'll come across a problem. Even so, the
solution is quite simple. You get an armlet, so you take it back to the owner.
Go to Chapter 4 "Desert City Messiah", go south, and all will be fixed.

When you're taken to the White Chronicle, skip to "Warlord's Request".


====================
  Itolia Wasteland
====================

Go north for an arrow storm. Move quickly. On the east side of the area is
Special Tea x2. Head west and go straight for the ballistas here. They're weak
to fire, like pretty much all shield types. You'll get a scene; two more to
the east.

So east you go to meet Garland. Push a barrel to the eastern rocks and cross
to the next screen. Go east again and check the north side for a hidden 3000G.
Back west and north into the cave. Go west for an Iron Charm, then go back to
the north path.

Go straight for the ballistas again.

  | can easily go for Aht or Raynie in this fight. You're going to be         |
  | fighting over a Heal Zone. Just keep pushing him out. They're also quite  |
  | fond of curse, which keeps you from using items. Stocke is good for that. |
  | Gardner seems more resistant to magic, so keep that in mind.              |

Well, head north twice, then west. Check out the south side for a hidden barrel
and blow up the rocks to make a path to Tungsten Mail. Back east and blow up
the rocks to the north. Skalla is north of there. As you do that... :P

      "The past".

    • Go to "How to Disappear" (the next node you can travel to) and head back
      down to the sewers. Go west and check out the north side for a hidden
      Sunlight Pact.

      you have a node opened up to you. Go ahead and learn the techs you have.
      Eruca should learn Divine Light. Eruca is a thousand times more useful.
      Aht will be, once you get more of her traps.

  Skalla

Upon entry, you'll meet a familar merchant. Go inside the building and talk to
him. You get a Sand Sword. Not a sidequest.

Head to the inn now. It doesn't matter how you get there, just keep heading
toward the east exit in Itolia.

Go east twice.

      corpse. Bring the item you find back to Liese.

    • On the east side, near the corpse, is a hidden Roll-Cut Scroll.

Grab the Beast Charm in the area too before returning to Liese. From there,
west, then north. Go northwest and grab the Healing Fruit, then return and take
the northeast path.

Exit is to the north, but before that... Right next to where you're standing
is a barrel. You can't see it, but it's there, just hug the south wall. Blow
up the obstacle for a hidden Gaia Blade. Head east and do some bush whacking
for Tourniquet x2. Leave.


===============
  Holff Ruins
===============

Go ahead and enter the ruins. It's quite jarring to see a bunch of gorillas
chase after you. There is a switch in the floor to the north. Hit it and
proceed through the door.

Head east for a hidden 4000G, then go through the nearby door. Follow that path
to Snow White. Back to the hidden chest and to the north exit for a hidden
Expert Fist. Now west to a hidden Celestial Dew and another door. Head north.

      Be sure to learn the skills soon!

Through the door to the southeast for Divine Water.

Back, then take the northeast path and go down the stairs. Skip the save point
and go west, south, south for Special Tea x2. North, north, east, north to
push the switch. Back to the save point and through the doors.

      Believe in him --> Continue
      Leave it to her -> Bad end

    • Then go find the soldier for a Promised Knife.

Back to the main show. Head all the way over to "Overcoming the Trial" and talk
to Bergas.

Wait for the Gutrals -> Continue
Lead the way ---------> Bad end

Since you saved Pierre's sister and ensured the survival of Will and Otto, you
can now proceed without hitting a wall.

You can go straight for the castle for once, then to the throne.

You now have Etherion, and you can pass an obstacle you didn't know you had. It

Before going onto the ramp to the Elder's place, you'll find a hard-to-see
barrel to the east. Drag it to the west for Tourniquet x2. Next to the Elder's
home is a hidden Giant Cape.

Talk to the elder for Chapter 5.

You'll automatically be in Skalla. Go in the inn, then talk to the three
soldiers west of the inn for a fight.

They're mooks, but strong mooks. So save, juuuust in case. Btw, the weapon you
can steal isn't half bad. Talk to Rosch to continue.

  | Fire on the Cannons, then lightning on the Thautomaton. Aht isn't a bad   |
  | choice after you get the cannons down. She has Polaris and a great trap.  |
  | If you don't have G-Thunder with Raynie (I didn't), Aht is probably       |
  | superior. Use G-Fire instead of Thunder if you insist on Raynie. Once his |

    • Then go back and talk to Marco. You get Priere Bonheur.

Back to where you were in time, then to the alley by the bar in Granorg. Rush

  | Thautomaton is weak to lightning. The stones are obnoxious in that they   |

  | Dias Knights must die. Gold is weak to Ice, Sapphire to Fire. Push        |
  | Assault to take out Gold first, and the knight behind him. Use Marco or   |
  | Gafka to pull them back into a trap, or you can simply use Raynie to hit  |
  | them. Eruca would be fine if she knew more than G-Frost, but you may be   |
  | able to make a use for her anyway. Watch out for Sapphire if it's the     |
  | last one though. Ouch. Might want to turn break that sucker.              |

  | Aht may not be the best for this because you can't push around the Auto   |
  | Defenders. Eruca is cool because of Divine Light and her all-hitting      |
  | spells. Raynie works, as always. Push Viola on top of the Auto Defenders  |
  | and do your best to get around Divine Light (alternatively, boost Eruca's |
  | magic and hit everyone at once; ignore the moving). However, do not let   |
  | her be in the middle of the back row. If you use Eruca and Marco, you can |
  | use trans-turn to give yourself the opportunity to use Divine Light.      |
  | Further, you can use Spin Slash and Double Attack to get through the      |
  | Divine Light your enemy uses. Gafka also has Musou in place of Spin Slash.|

  | The blocks should die first; they're easier. However, the tiger will use  |
  | Wild Shout when alone. So try to hit them all at once, then take out the  |
  | tiger as fast as possible. Aht's traps are the best method, since you can |
  | push the tiger into two at once sometimes, just be sure to use Flame Star.|

Go north for a Panacea Plus. Then back to the first room and west. On the north
side is a hidden Freikugel Mercy. Again to the first room, but east this time.
Down the vine, grab the Nirvana Plate, and go east for another vine. Keep going
till you hit a save point. Continue up the vines till you find a hidden Der
Lowe, then back to the save point.

Keep going west for a scene. Go northwest, down the vine, and grab Shield Seed
Plus x2. Take the west exit in the save point room now, grab the Divine Water,
and head up the vine. Follow the path all the way north for a hidden Wing
Armlet and continue for another scene.

Climb up the vine for a Superior Tea, then back down and east. Down the vines
to the next room, where you'll find another vine. And another, and another...

Once down and out, go east. You can't see it, but there's a door there. Grab
the Tourniquet...

Save, use a Mana Crystal, then proceed north to Mr. Bossy.

  | You want to get rid of the shadows, and quick. Aht is the easiest way,    |
  | though she'll probably die right after managing to get rid of them. Heiss |
  | has Dark World, which hurts everyone for a lot. I recommend Marco as your |
  | other person, though Rosch also works. In any case, right after you have  |
  | the blocks dealt with, turn break Heiss and start shoving him into traps. |
  | He'll spam Dark World like crazy if you don't.                            |
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

If you need items and whatnot, this is the time to do it. Go to "Aht's Prayer"
in chapter 1 and...

  | Can't get enough of him, eh? This is another good day for Aht. Heiss has  |
  | a new, powerful move called Shadow Kill. It can easily kill one person.   |
  | When he's alone, he'll start using Dark World again. Otherwise, however,  |
  | he's actually a little less obnoxious and will go down easier.            |

You can leave the castle if you need anything.

There's a hidden barrel to the northwest, and another to the northeast. Use
them to get through to the north and the Luminous Dress in the middle of the
room. The next room has a block.

Something cute. It'll change its weakness. Fire Change makes it ice, Ice Change
makes it lightning.

Fight it and push to the north. You'll find crystals in your way. I always ran;
they're obnoxious. Now you have two blocks. Fight one and push it to the east.
Grab the Celestial Oil and fight your new block. Push it north, then fight the
other block on the island. Take that block and make another eastern path. Fight
the block to the north and drag it to make yet another eastern path for
Superior Tea. Next block, then north with it.

    • Drag a northern hidden barrel alllll the way back to the rocks. Blow up
      the northern-most rock for a Soul Pact.

Furthermore, if you drag the both hidden barrel to the south side of the
rocks and make your way east with them, you should find a hidden Sky Armlet.
Yes, it's annoying.

Find the final block to the north and drag it west for Panacea Plus x2. Now
take the northern path.

Node created, save point availible. You can and should go back to any point in
time to get items, etc. between battles.

"Gafka & the Scrolls" has Healing Fruit, if you are desperate for them like I
was. Also check it out for some nice accessories, if you need some good ones.

But first, check out the southwest for hidden barrels. Drag one to the
northwest for Tourniquet x2. Drag the other northeast, then south for Superior
Tea x2.

  | You can kill Palomides easy with just a couple Volt Stars from Aht. Make  |
  | sure two get set down, and push him into both at once. He'll die QUICK.   |
  | While you can't move the Pure Ice, you can lift them. Cross Star is good  |
  | for that.                                                                 |

  | Aht may not be the best this time... but she works, assuming the spider   |
  | doesn't stomp on her first. You can poison still, but there isn't much    |
  | else you can do. Just revive the dead (Marco and Stocke are best because  |
  | of this) and have someone else attack.                                    |

  | Finally, a real boss. You can take Aht, but you have to be fast in        |
  | killing the Stones. A few Will o' Wisps should take them out. You could   |
  | also use someone like Gafka to take out the Flames, though you don't have |
  | to. Try to use Cross Star on Viola and one or two of the flames. Once you |
  | get the freedom to push Viola around into traps, she'll die really fast.  |
  | I recommend Marco as the third for Trans-Turn. It's just that awesome.    |

Go north to find... Eruca! Finally. You'll also get the final node.


=============================
  To Grind, or Not to Grind
=============================

If you just wanna beat the final boss and ignore the rest of the sidequests,
52 is a decent level to do so... with Raynie and Marco, which is far from the
best of teams. You could get by with lower with a different setup.

If you want to do sidequests, you'll want to grind. If they're far below Stocke
in level, they'll gain more exp.

Where to grind? Well, you have to do it without Eruca, but go to Sand Fortress
North in AH Final Chapter and fight the flies. It's fantastic; weak enemies,
tons of EXP. Thanks to Silverdrake of GFAQs for figuring this out.

If you want to level Eruca, go to Sand Fortress anyway, then grind on the
crystals in the final dungeon.

Take the opportunity to learn what skills you haven't from Vainqueur.

    • Now is a good opportunity to finish what you started with Bergas in
      chapter 5, "Gafka & the Scrolls". I did this at level 42.

    • First battle, I changed to where Gafka could hit three times in a row and
      used Triple Strike each time.

    • Second battle, I changed so he could have two strikes, and used Musou and
      Sky Hammer (his Mana Burst).

      battle against a bear. At your level it should be easy. You'll get a
      Pieti Edge.

      Waters, and just goddamn survive. I used 7 Holy Waters and 1 Divine
      Water. I used Resurrection all other times. You get Moirae Manteau for

    • You can do this after the final boss. Like everything else, really.

    • To chapter 6, "The Three Contracts" for the hardest boss battle in the
      game. Up your MDF as much as possible, even at the expense of DEF.

      My party was Stocke 59, Aht 58, Eruca 45.

    • You start out fighting the Master's House. A spider. If you survive the
      first couple rounds, you should be able to turn break the spider with
      everyone and NUKE with magic. Use Dancing Death with Aht a couple times,
      then hit him with everything you have. G-Frost works great. You might
      want to restart till his first attack isn't a damaging one, because the
      next battle's going to hit you hard.

    • The second part is against the master... four of him. They're so fond of
      power down that you aren't getting far with physical attacks. Use Polaris
      and Lunatic with Aht to deal with this guy, though you still need Noah
      Amulet and Sky Drops (from Forgia) as accessories. It's not a bad idea to
      throw a Magic Herb on Eruca, then Dancing Death + Burst Light. But this
      may not work if Eruca is always sleeping or dead. So the other way it to
      take them one at a time, but using more powerful techs. I recommend the
      other way; takes longer, but it has a higher chance of working.

      Start out using Shield Seed Plus, if you have them, crossing your fingers
      qnd Dancing Death + Double Strike + G-Frost to kill one of them. Or
      G-Frost + any Star trap + left/right assault (or Trans-turn so you can do
      it twice, depending on the space you have). Then focus on keeping Divine
      Light up with Eruca as Stocke and Aht go at it.

      The battle gets easier as you chip away at their numbers.

    • Give up Historica for True Historica.

Ok, time for the final boss. If I can manage with Marco/Raynie, you can manage
with anyone. Only one I can't recommend is Aht, though you could probably
manage.

  |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
  | Thought you were done? THIS is why Aht isn't a great idea. Marco isn't so |
  | bad so long as he has Super Heal. Everyone else will work fine. The boss  |
  | has three parts: bottom, middle, top.                                     |
  |                                                                           |
  | First form is very easy; hits hard, but goes down real fast. You might as |
  | well use all your turn breaks on the second form, as form three will      |
  | destroy your mana gauge. Anyway, the second form adds status effects to   |
  | the mix. Just before he dies, he'll use Fallout on you, maybe twice. It   |
  | HURTS.                                                                    |
  |                                                                           |
  | Then form three. This one is deadlier. Don't be afraid to use Celestial   |
  | Oil or something if your MP is out. Panacea Plus is a must if you don't   |
  | have Marco. If you use Eruca, use G-Frost and keep a Divine Shield on     |
  | everyone at all times. Easier than it sounds.                             |
  |                                                                           |
  | If you see him use Dark Matter, DEFEND. Or Shield Seed Plus. Or Divine    |
  | Light. The next attack is going to be one of the worst things you've ever |
  | seen if you don't.                                                        |
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Did you do all the sidequests? There are about 10 of 'em that lead to the true
end. You'll get an event node for each one you've done.

The final choice doesn't matter.
